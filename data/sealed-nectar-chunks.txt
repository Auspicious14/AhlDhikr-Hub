Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)\nmanifestedly represents an exhaustive embodiment of the sublime Divine Message\nthat he communicated in order to deliver the human race from the swamp of\ndarkness and polytheism to the paradise of light and monotheism. An image,\nauthentic as well as comprehensive, of this Message is therefore only attainable\nthrough careful study and profound analysis of both backgrounds and issues of such\na biography. In view of this, a whole chapter is here introduced about the nature and\ndevelopment of Arab tribes prior to Islam as well as the circumstantial environment\nthat enwrapped the Prophet's mission.\nLocation of the Arabs\nLinguistically, the word \"Arab\" means deserts and waste barren land well- nigh\nwaterless and treeless. Ever since the dawn of history, the Arabian Peninsula and its\npeople have been called as such.\nThe Arabian Peninsula is enclosed in the west by the Red Sea and Sinai, in the east\nby the Arabian Gulf, in the south by the Arabian Sea, which is an extension of the\nIndian Ocean, and in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq. The area is estimated\nbetween a million and a million and a quarter square miles.\nThanks to its geographical position, the peninsula has always maintained great\nimportance.. Considering its internal setting, it is mostly deserts and sandy places,\nwhich has rendered it inaccessible to foreigners and invaders, and allowed its people\ncomplete liberty and independence through the ages, despite the presence of two\nneighbouring great empires.\nIts external setting, on the other hand, caused it to be the centre of the old world\nand provided it with sea and land links with most nations at the time. Thanks to this\nstrategic position the Arabian Peninsula had become the centre for trade, culture,\nreligion and art.\nArab Tribes\nArab kinfolks have been divided according to lineage into three groups:\n1. \tPerishing Arabs: \tThe ancient Arabs, of whose history little is known, and of\nwhom were ‘Ad, Tham? , Tasam, Jadis, Emlaq, and others.\n2. \tPure Arabs: \tWho originated from the progeny of Ya‘rub bin Yashjub bin\nQahtan. They were also called Qahtanian Arabs.\n3. \tArabized Arabs: \tWho originated from the progeny of Ishmael. They were\nalso called ‘Adnanian Arabs.\nThe pure Arabs – the people of Qahtan – originally lived in Yemen and comprised\nmany tribes, two of which were very famous:\na. \tHimyar: The most famous of whose septs were Zaid Al- Jamhur, Quda‘a and\nSakasic.\n\n-- 8 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n9\nb. \tKahlan: The most famous of whose septs were Hamdan, Anmar, Tai’,\nMudhhij, Kinda, Lakhm, Judham, Azd, Aws, Khazraj and the descendants of\nJafna — the kings of old Syria.\nKahlan septs emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian\nPeninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al- ‘Arim \tof Ma’rib Dam), due to the failure of\ntrade under the Roman pressure and domain on both sea and land trade routes\nfollowing Roman occupation of Egypt and Syria.\nNaturally enough, the competition between Kahlan and Himyar led to the evacuation\nof the first and the settlement of the second in Yemen.\nThe emigrating septs of Kahlan can be divided into four groups:\n1. \tAzd: \tWho, under the leadership of ‘Imran bin ‘Amr Muzaiqb?#146;, wandered\nin Yemen, sent pioneers and finally headed northwards. Details of their\nemigration can be summed up as follows:\nTha‘labah bin ‘Amr left his tribe Al- Azd for Hijaz and dwelt between\nTha‘labiyah and Dhi Qar. When he gained strength, he headed for Madinah\nwhere he stayed. Of his seed are Aws and Khazraj, sons of Haritha bin\nTha‘labah.\nHaritha bin ‘Amr, known as Khuza‘a, wandered with his folks in Hijaz until\nthey came to Mar Az- Zahran. Later, they conquered the Haram, and settled in\nMakkah after having driven away its people, the tribe of Jurhum.\n‘Imran bin ‘Amr and his folks went to ‘Oman where they established the tribe\nof Azd whose children inhabited Tihama and were known as Azd- of- Shanu’a.\nJafna bin ‘Amr and his family, headed for Syria where he settled and initiated\nthe kingdom of Ghassan who was so named after a spring of water, in Hijaz,\nwhere they stopped on their way to Syria.\n2. \tLakhm and Judham: \tOf whom was Nasr bin Rabi‘a, father of Manadhira,\nKings of Heerah.\n3. \tBanu Tai’: \tWho also emigrated northwards to settle by the so- called Aja and\nSalma Mountains which were consequently named as Tai’ Mountains.\n4. \tKinda: \tWho dwelt in Bahrain but were expelled to Hadramout and Najd\nwhere they instituted a powerful government but not for long , for the whole\ntribe soon faded away.\nAnother tribe of Himyar, known as Quda‘a, also left Yemen and dwelt in Samawa\nsemi- desert on the borders of Iraq.\nThe Arabized Arabs go back in ancestry to their great grandfather Abraham [AWS]\nfrom a town called \"Ar\" near Kufa on the west bank of the Euphrates in Iraq.\nExcavations brought to light great details of the town, Abraham’s family, and the\nprevalent religions and social circumstances. \t[Tafheem- ul- Qur'an, 1/553]\nIt is known that Abraham [AWS] left Ar for Harran and then for Palestine, which he\nmade headquarters for his Message. He wandered all over the area. When he went\n\n-- 9 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n10\nto Egypt, the Pharaoh tried to do evil to his wife Sarah, but All? \tsaved her and the\nPharaoh’s wicked scheme recoiled on him. He thus came to realize her strong\nattachment to All? \t, and, in acknowledgment of her grace, the Pharaoh rendered his\ndaughter Hagar at Sarah’s service, but Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham as a wife.\n[Bukhari 1/474]\nAbraham returned to Palestine where Hagar gave birth to Ishmael. Sarah became so\njealous of Hagar that she forced Abraham to send Hagar and her baby away to a\nplantless valley on a small hill in Hijaz, by the Sacred House, exposed to the wearing\nof floods coming right and left. He chose for them a place under a lofty tree above\nZamzam near the upper side of the Mosque in Makkah where neither people nor\nwater was available, and went back to Palestine leaving with his wife and baby a\nleather case with some dates and a pot of water. Not before long, they ran out of\nboth food and water, but thanks to All? \t’s favour water gushed forth to sustain them\nfor sometime. The whole story of Zamzam spring is already known to everybody.\n[Bukhari 1/475]\nAnother Yemeni tribe – Jurhum the Second – came and lived in Makkah upon Hagar’s\npermission, after being said to have lived in the valleys around Makkah. It is\nmentioned in the Sahih Al- Bukhari that this tribe came to Makkah before Ishmael\nwas a young man while they had passed through that valley long before this event.\nAbraham used to go to Makkah every now and then to see his wife and son. The\nnumber of these journeys is still unknown, but authentic historical resources spoke of\nfour ones.\nAll? \t, the Sublime, stated in the Noble Qur’? \tthat He had Abraham see, in his\ndream, that he slaughtered his son Ishmael, and therefore Abraham stood up to\nfulfill His Order:\n\"Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will of All? \t), and\nhe had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead for\nslaughtering); and We called out to him: \"O Abraham! You have fulfilled the\ndream (vision)!\" Verily! Thus do we reward the Muhsin? \t(good- doers, who\nperform good deeds totally for All? \t’s sake only, without any show off or to\ngain praise or fame, etc. and do them in accordance to All? \t’s Orders).\nVerily, that indeed was a manifest trial — and We ransomed him with a\ngreat sacrifice (i.e. a ram)\" \t[37:103- 107]\nIt is mentioned in the Genesis that Ishmael was thirteen years older than his brother\nIshaq. The sequence of the story of the sacrifice of Ishmael shows that it really\nhappened before Ishaq’s birth, and that All? \t’s Promise to give Abraham another son,\nIshaq, came after narration of the whole story.\nThis story spoke of one journey – at least – before Ishmael became a young man.\nAl- Bukhari, on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas, reported the other three journeys; a\nsummary of which goes as follows:\nWhen Ishmael became a young man, he learned Arabic at the hand of the tribe of\nJurhum, who loved him with great admiration and gave him one of their women as a\nwife, soon after his mother died. Having wanted to see his wife and son again,\n\n-- 10 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n11\nAbraham came to Makkah, after Ishmael’s marriage, but he didn’t find him at home.\nHe asked Ishmael’s wife about her husband and how they were doing. She\ncomplained of poverty, so he asked her to tell Ishmael to change his doorstep.\nIshmael understood the message, divorced his wife and got married to the daughter\nof Mudad bin ‘Amr, chief of the tribe of Jurhum. [Qalb Jazeerat Al- Arab, p 230]\nOnce more, Abraham came to see his son, but again didn’t find him at home. He\nasked his new wife the same previous question, to which she thanked All? \t. Abraham\nasked her to tell Ishmael to keep his doorstep (i.e. to keep her as wife) and went\nback to Palestine.\nA third time, Abraham came to Makkah to find Ishmael sharpening an arrow under a\nlofty tree near Zamzam. The meeting, after a very long journey of separation, was\nvery touching for a father so affectionate and a so dutiful and righteous son. This\ntime, father and son built Al- Ka‘bah and raised its pillars, and Abraham, in\ncompliance with All? \t’s Commandment, called unto people to make pilgrimage to it.\nBy the grace of All? \t, Ishmael had twelve sons from the daughter of Mudad, whose\nnames were Nabet, Qidar, Edbael, Mebsham, Mishma’, Duma, Micha, Hudud, Yetma,\nYetour, Nafis and Qidman, and who ultimately formed twelve tribes inhabiting\nMakkah and trading between Yemen, geographical Syria and Egypt. Later on, these\ntribes spread all over, and even outside, the peninsula. All their tidings went into\noblivion except for the descendants of Nabet and Qidar.\nThe Nabeteans – sons of Nabet – established a flourishing civilization in the north of\nHijaz, they instituted a powerful government which spread out its domain over all\nneighbouring tribes, and made Petra their capital. Nobody dared challenge their\nauthority until the Romans came and managed to eliminate their kingdom. After\nextensive research and painstaking investigation, Mr. Sulaiman An- Nadwi came to\nthe conclusion that the Ghassanide kings, along with the Aws and Khazraj were not\nlikely to be Qahtanians but rather Nabeteans. [Tareekh Ard Al- Qur'an 2/78- 86]\nDescendants of Qidar, the son of Ishmael, lived long in Makkah increasing in\nnumber, of them issued ‘Adnan and son Ma‘ad, to whom ‘Adnanian Arabs traced\nback their ancestry. ‘Adnan is the twenty- first grandfather in the series of the\nProphetic ancestry. It was said that whenever Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] spoke of\nhis ancestry he would stop at ‘Adnan and say: \"Genealogists tell lies\" and did not go\nfarther than him. A group of scholars, however, favoured the probability of going\nbeyond ‘Adnan attaching no significance to the aforementioned Prophetic \tHadith.\nThey went on to say that there were exactly forty fathers between ‘Adnan and\nAbraham [AWS]. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/7- 17]\nNizar, Ma‘ad’s only son , had four sons who branched out into four great tribes;\nEyad, Anmar, Rabi‘a and Mudar. These last two sub- branched into several septs.\nRabi‘a fathered Asad, ‘Anazah, ‘Abdul Qais, and Wa’il’s two sons (Bakr and Taghlib),\nHanifa and many others.\nMudar tribes branched out into two great divisions: Qais ‘Ailan bin Mudar and septs\nof Elias bin Mudar. Of Qais ‘Ailan were the Banu Saleem, Banu Hawazin, and Banu\nGhatafan of whom descended ‘Abs, Zubyan, Ashja‘ and Ghani bin A‘sur. Of Elias bin\nMudar were Tamim bin Murra, Hudhail bin Mudrika, Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah and\n\n-- 11 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n12\nsepts of Kinana bin Khuzaimah, of whom came Quraish, the descendants of Fahr bin\nMalik bin An- Nadr bin Kinana.\nQuraish branched out into various tribes, the most famous of whom were Jumah,\nSahm, ‘Adi, Makhzum, Tayim, Zahra and the three septs of Qusai bin Kilab: ‘Abdud-\nDar bin Qusai, Asad bin ‘Abdul ‘Uzza bin Qusai and ‘Abd Manaf bin Qusai.\n‘Abd Manaf branched out into four tribes: ‘Abd Shams, Nawfal, Muttalib and Hashim.\nIt is, however, from the family of Hashim that All? \tselected Prophet Muhammad bin\n‘Abdullah bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib bin Hashim [pbuh].\nProphet Muhammad [pbuh] said:\n\"All? \tselected Ishmael from the sons of Abraham, Kinana from the sons of\nIshmael, Quraish from the sons of Kinana, Hashim from the sons of Quraish\nand He selected me from the sons of Hashim.\" \t[Muslim 2/245; Tirmidhi 2/201]\nAl- ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib quoted the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] as saying:\n\"All? \tcreated mankind and chose me from the best whereof, He chose the\ntribes and selected me from the best whereof; and He chose families and\nselected me from the best whereof. I am the very best in person and\nfamily.\" \t[Tirmidhi 2/201]\nHaving increased in number, children of ‘Adnan, in pursuit of pastures and water,\nspread out over various parts of Arabia.\nThe tribe of ‘Abdul Qais, together with some septs of Bakr bin Wa’il and Tamim,\nemigrated to Bahrain where they dwelt.\nBanu Hanifa bin Sa‘b bin Ali bin Bakr went to settle in Hijr, the capital of Yamama. All\nthe tribes of Bakr bin Wa’il lived in an area of land which included Yamama, Bahrain,\nSaif Kazima, the sea shore, the outer borders of Iraq, Ablah and Hait.\nMost of the tribe of Taghlib lived in the Euphrates area while some of them lived with\nBakr.\nBanu Tamim lived in Basra semi- desert.\nBanu Saleem lived in the vicinity of Madinah on the land stretching from Wadi Al-\nQura to Khaibar onwards to the eastern mountains to Harrah.\nThaqif dwelt in Ta’if and Hawazin east of Makkah near Autas on the road from\nMakkah to Basra.\nBanu Asad lived on the land east of Taim?#146; and west of Kufa, while family of\nTai’ lived between Banu Asad and Taim?#146;. They were five- day- walk far from\nKufa.\nZubyan inhabited the plot of and between Taim?#146; and Hawran.\n\n-- 12 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n13\nSome septs of Kinana lived in Tihama, while septs of Quraish dwelt in Makkah and its\nsuburbs. Quraish remained completely disunited until Qusai bin Kilab managed to\nrally their ranks on honourable terms attaching major prominence to their status and\nimportance. [Muhadrat Tareekh Al- Umam Al- Islamiyah 1/15- 16]\n\n-- 13 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n14\nRulership and Princeship among the Arabs\nWhen talking about the Arabs before Islam,we deem it necessary to draw a mini-\npicture of the history of rulership, princeship, sectarianism and the religious\ndominations of the Arabs, so as to facilitate the understanding of emergent\ncircumstances when Islam appeared.\nWhen the sun of Islam rose, rulers of Arabia were of two kinds: crowned kings, who\nwere in fact not independent; and heads of tribes and clans, who enjoyed the same\nauthorities and privileges possessed by crowned kings and were mostly independent,\nthough some of whom could have shown some kind of submission to a crowned king.\nThe crowned kings were only those of Yemen, Heerah and Ghassan. All other rulers\nof Arabia were non- crowned.\nRulership in Yemen\nThe folks of Sheba were one of the oldest nations of the pure Arabs, who lived in\nYemen. Excavations at \"Or\" brought to light their existence twenty five centuries\nB.C. Their civilization flourished, and their domain spread eleven centuries B.C.\nIt is possible to divide their ages according to the following estimation:\n1. \tThe centuries before 650 B.C., during which their kings were called \"Makrib\nSheba\". Their capital was \"Sarwah\", also known as \"Khriba\", whose ruins lie\nin a spot, a day’s walk from the western side of \"Ma’rib\". During this period,\nthey started building the \"Dam of Ma’rib\" which had great importance in the\nhistory of Yemen. Sheba was also said to have had so great a domain that\nthey had colonies inside and outside Arabia.\n2. \tFrom 650 B.C. until 115 B.C. During this era, they gave up the name \"Makrib\"\nand assumed the designation of \"Kings of Sheba\". They also made Ma’rib\ntheir capital instead of Sarwah. The ruins of Ma’rib lie at a distance of sixty\nmiles east of San‘a.\n3. \tFrom 115 B.C. until 300 A.D. During this period, the tribe of Himyar\nconquered the kingdom of Sheba and took Redan for capital instead of Ma’rib.\nLater on, Redan was called \"Zifar\". Its ruins still lie on Mudawwar Mountain\nnear the town of \"Yarim\". During this period, they began to decline and fall.\nTheir trade failed to a very great extent, firstly, because of the Nabetean\ndomain over the north of Hijaz; secondly, because of the Roman superiority\nover the naval trade routes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria and the\nnorth of Hijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter- tribal warfare. Thanks to the\nthree above- mentioned factors, families of Qahtan were disunited and\nscattered out.\n4. \tFrom 300 A.D. until Islam dawned on Yemen. This period witnessed a lot of\ndisorder and turmoil. The great many and civil wars rendered the people of\nYemen liable to foreign subjection and hence loss of independence. During\nthis era, the Romans conquered ‘Adn and even helped the Abyssinians\n(Ethiopians) to occupy Yemen for the first time in 340 A.D., making use of the\nconstant intra- tribal conflict of Hamdan and Himyar. The Abyssinian\n(Ethiopian) occupation of Yemen lasted until 378 A.D., whereafter Yemen\nregained its independence. Later on, cracks began to show in Ma’rib Dam\nwhich led to the Great Flood (450 or 451 A.D.) mentioned in the Noble Qur’? \t.\n\n-- 14 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n15\nThis was a great event which caused the fall of the entire Yemeni civilization\nand the dispersal of the nations living therein.\nIn 523, Dhu Nawas, a Jew, despatched a great campaign against the Christians of\nNajran in order to force them to convert into Judaism. Having refused to do so, they\nwere thrown alive into a big ditch where a great fire had been set. The Qur’?\nreferred to this event:\n\"Cursed were the people of the ditch.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 85:4]\nThis aroused great wrath among the Christians, and especially the Roman emperors,\nwho not only instigated the Abyssinians (Ethiopians) against Arabs but also\nassembled a large fleet which helped the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) army, of seventy\nthousand warriors, to effect a second conquest of Yemen in 525 A.D., under the\nleadership of Eriat, who was granted rulership over Yemen, a position he held until\nhe was assassinated by one of his army leaders, Abraha, who, after reconciliation\nwith the king of Abyssinia, took rulership over Yemen and, later on, deployed his\nsoldiers to demolish Al- Ka‘bah, and , hence, he and his soldiers came to be known as\nthe \"Men of the Elephant\".\nAfter the \"Elephant\" incident, the people of Yemen, under the leadership of\nMa‘dikarib bin Saif Dhu Yazin Al- Himyari, and through Persian assistance, revolted\nagainst the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) invaders, restored independence and appointed\nMa‘dikarib as their king. However, Ma‘dikarib was assassinated by an Abyssinian\n(Ethiopian) he used to have him around for service and protection. The family of Dhu\nYazin was thus deprived of royalty forever. Kisra, the Persian king, appointed a\nPersian ruler over San‘a and thus made Yemen a Persian colony. Persian rulers\nmaintained rulership of Yemen until Badhan, the last of them, embraced Islam in 638\nA.D., thus terminating the Persian domain over Yemen.\nR",
  "ulership in Heerah\nEver since Korosh the Great (557- 529 B.C.) united the Persians, they ruled Iraq and\nits neighbourhood. Nobody could shake off their authority until Alexander the Great\nvanquished their king Dara I and thus subdued the Persians in 326 B.C. Persian\nlands were thenceforth divided and ruled by kings known as \"the Kings of Sects\", an\nera which lasted until 230 A.D. Meanwhile, the Qahtanians occupied some Iraqi\nterritories, and were later followed by some ‘Adnanians who managed to share some\nparts of Mesopotamia with them.\nThe Persians, under the leadership of Ardashir, who had established the Sasanian\nstate in 226 A.D, regained enough unity and power to subdue the Arabs living in the\nvicinity of their kingdom, and force Quda‘a to leave for Syria , leaving the people of\nHeerah and Anbar under the Persian domain.\nDuring the time of Ardashir, Juzaima Alwaddah exercised rulership over Heerah,\nRabi‘a and Mudar, and Mesopotamia. Ardashir had reckoned that it was impossible\nfor him to rule the Arabs directly and prevent them from attacking his borders unless\nhe appointed as king one of them who enjoyed support and power of his tribe. He\nhad also seen that he could make use of them against the Byzantine kings who\nalways used to harass him. At the same time, the Arabs of Iraq could face the Arabs\n\n-- 15 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n16\nof Syria who were in the hold of Byzantine kings. However, he deemed it fit to keep\na Persian battalion under command of the king of Heerah to be used against those\nArabs who might rebel against him.\nAfter the death of Juzaima around 268 A.D., ‘Amr bin ‘Adi bin Nasr Al- Lakhmi was\nappointed as king by the Persian King Sabour bin Ardashir. ‘Amr was the first of the\nLakhmi kings who ruled Heerah until the Persians appointed Qabaz bin Fairuz in\nwhose reign appeared someone called Mazdak, who called for dissoluteness in social\nlife. Qabaz, and many of his subjects, embraced Mazdak’s religion and even called\nupon the king of Heerah, Al- Munzir bin Ma’ As- Sama’, to follow after. When the\nlatter, because of his pride and self- respect, rejected their orders, Qabaz discharged\nhim and nominated Harith bin ‘Amr bin Hajar Al- Kindi, who had accepted the Mazdaki\ndoctrine.\nNo sooner did Kisra Anu Shairwan succeed Qabaz than he, due to hatred of Mazdak’s\nphilosophy, killed Mazdak and many of his followers, restored Munzir to the throne of\nHeerah and gave orders to summon under arrest Harith who sought refuge with Al-\nKalb tribe where he spent the rest of his life.\nSons of Al- Munzir bin Ma’ As- Sama’ maintained kingship a long time until An- Nu‘man\nbin Al- Munzir took over. Because of a calumny borne by Zaid bin ‘Adi Al- ‘Abbadi, the\nPersian king got angry with An- Nu‘man and summoned him to his palace. An- Nu‘man\nwent secretly to Hani bin Mas‘ud, chief of Shaiban tribe, and left his wealth and\nfamily under the latter’s protection, and then presented himself before the Persian\nking, who immediately threw him into prison where he perished. Kisra, then,\nappointed Eyas bin Qubaisa At- Ta’i as king of Heerah. Eyas was ordered to tell Hani\nbin Mas‘ud to deliver An- Nu‘man’s charge up to Kisra. No sooner than had the\nPersian king received the fanatically motivated rejection on the part of the Arab\nchief, he declared war against the tribe of Shaiban and mobilized his troops and\nwarriors under the leadership of King Eyas to a place called Dhee Qar which\nwitnessed a most furious battle wherein the Persians were severely routed by the\nArabs for the first time in history. That was very soon after the birth of Prophet\nMuhammad [pbuh] eight months after Eyas bin Qubaisah’s rise to power over\nHeerah.\nAfter Eyas, a Persian ruler was appointed over Heerah, but in 632 A.D. the authority\nthere returned to the family of Lukhm when Al- Munzir Al- Ma‘rur took over. Hardly\nhad the latter’s reign lasted for eight months when Khalid bin Al- Waleed fell upon\nhim with Muslim soldiers. [Muhadrat Tareekh Al- Umam Al- Islamiyah 1/29- 32]\nRulership in Geographical Syria\nIn the process of the tribal emigrations, some septs of Quda‘a reached the borders of\nSyria where they settled down. They belonged to the family of Sulaih bin Halwan, of\nwhose offspring were the sons of Duj‘am bin Sulaih known as Ad- Duja‘ima. Such\nsepts of Quda‘a were used by the Byzantines in the defence of the Byzantine borders\nagainst both Arab Bedouin raiders and the Persians, and enjoyed autonomy for a\nconsiderable phase of time which is said to have lasted for the whole second century\nA.D. One of their most famous kings was Zyiad bin Al- Habula. Their authority\nhowever came to an end upon defeat by the Ghassanides who were consequently\ngranted the proxy rulership over the Arabs of Syria and had Dumat Al- Jandal as their\nheadquarters, which lasted until the battle of Yarmuk in the year 13 A.H. Their last\n\n-- 16 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n17\nking Jabala bin Al- Aihum embraced Islam during the reign of the Chief of Believers,\n‘Umar bin Al- Khattab [R]. \t[Muhadrat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah 1/34; Tareekh Ard Al-\nQur'an 2/80-82]\nRulership in Hijaz\nIshmael [AWS] administered authority over Makkah as well as custodianship of the\nHoly Sanctuary throughout his lifetime. Upon his death, at the age of 137, two of his\nsons, Nabet and Qidar, succeeded him. Later on, their maternal grandfather, Mudad\nbin ‘Amr Al- Jurhumi took over, thus transferring rulership over Makkah to the tribe of\nJurhum, preserving a venerable position, though very little authority for Ishmael’s\nsons due to their father’s exploits in building the Holy Sanctuary, a position they held\nuntil the decline of the tribe of Jurhum shortly before the rise of Bukhtanassar. [Ibn\nHisham 1/111]\nThe political role of the ‘Adnanides had begun to gain firmer grounds in Makkah,\nwhich could be clearly attested by the fact that upon Bukhtanassar’s first invasion of\nthe Arabs in ‘Dhati ‘Irq’, the leader of the Arabs was not from Jurhum. [Qalb Jazeerat\nAl- Arab, p.230]\nUpon Bukhtanassar’s second invasion in 587 B.C., however, the ‘Adnanides were\nfrightened out to Yemen, while Burmia An- Nabi fled to Syria with Ma‘ad, but when\nBukhtanassar’s pressure lessened, Ma‘ad returned to Makkah to find none of the\ntribe of Jurhum except Jursham bin Jalhamah, whose daughter, Mu‘ana, was given to\nMa‘ad as wife who, later, had a son by him named Nizar. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen,\n2/48]\nOn account of difficult living conditions and destitution prevalent in Makkah, the tribe\nof Jurhum began to ill- treat visitors of the Holy Sanctuary and extort its funds, which\naroused resentment and hatred of the ‘Adnanides (sons of Bakr bin ‘Abd Munaf bin\nKinana) who, with the help of the tribe of Khuza‘a that had come to settle in a\nneighbouring area called Marr Az- Zahran, invaded Jurhum and frightened them out\nof Makkah leaving rulership to Quda‘a in the middle of the second century A.D.\nUpon leaving Makkah, Jurhum filled up the well of Zamzam, levelled its place and\nburied a great many things in it. ‘Amr bin Al- Harith bin Mudad Al- Jurhumi was\nreported by Ibn Ishaq, the well- known historian, to have buried the two gold deer\ntogether with the Black Stone as well as a lot of jewelry and swords in Zamzam,\nprior to their sorrowful escape to Yemen. [Ibn Hisham 1/114,115]\nIshmael’s epoch is estimated to have lasted for twenty centuries B.C., which means\nthat Jurhum stayed in Makkah for twenty- one centuries and held rulership there for\nabout twenty centuries.\nUpon defeat of Jurhum, the tribe of Khuza‘a monopolized rulership over Makkah.\nMudar tribes, however, enjoyed three privileges:\nThe First: \tLeading pilgrims from ‘Arafat to Muzdalifah and then from Mina to the\n‘Aqabah Stoning Pillar. This was the authority of the family of Al- Ghawth bin Murra,\none of the septs of Elias bin Mudar, who were called ‘Sofa’. \tThis privilege meant that\nthe pilgrims were not allowed to throw stones at Al- ‘Aqabah until one of the ‘Sofa’\n\n-- 17 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n18\nmen did that. When they had finished stoning and wanted to leave the valley of\nMina, ‘Sofa’ men stood on the two sides of Al- ‘Aqabah and nobody would pass that\nposition until the men of ‘Sofa’ passed and cleared the way for the pilgrims. When\nSofa perished, the family of Sa‘d bin Zaid Manat from Tamim tribe took over.\nThe Second: \tAl- Ifadah \t(leaving for Mina after Muzdalifah) on sacrifice morning, and\nthis was the responsibility of the family of Adwan.\nThe Third: \tDeferment of the sacred months, and this was the responsibility of the\nfamily of Tamim bin ‘Adi from Bani Kinana.\nKhuza‘a’s reign in Makkah lasted for three hundred years, during which, the\n‘Adnanides spread all over Najd and the sides of Bahrain and Iraq, while small septs\nof Quraish remained on the sides of Makkah; they were Haloul, Harum and some\nfamilies of Kinana. They enjoyed no privileges in Makkah or in the Sacred House until\nthe appearance of Qusai bin Kilab, whose father is said to have died when he was\nstill a baby, and whose mother was subsequently married to Rabi‘a bin Haram, from\nthe tribe of Bani ‘Udhra. Rabi‘a took his wife and her baby to his homeland on the\nborders of Syria. When Qusai became a young man, he returned to Makkah, which\nwas ruled by Halil bin Habsha from Khuza‘a, who gave Qusai his daughter, Hobba, as\nwife. After Halil’s death, a war between Khuza‘a and Quraish broke out and resulted\nin Qusai’s taking hold of Makkah and the Sacred House. [Ibn Hisham 1/117]\nThe Reasons of this War have been illustrated in Three Versions\nThe First: \tHaving noticed the spread of his offspring, increase of his property and\nexalt of his honour after Halil’s death, Qusai found himself more entitled to shoulder\nresponsibility of rulership over Makkah and custodianship of the Sacred House than\nthe tribes of Khuza‘a and Bani Bakr. He also advocated that Quraish were the chiefs\nof Ishmael’s descendants. Therefore he consulted some men from Quraish and\nKinana concerning his desire to evacuate Khuza‘a and Bani Bakr from Makkah. They\ntook a liking to his opinion and supported him.\nThe Second: \tKhuza‘a claimed that Halil requested Qusai to hold custodianship of Al-\nKa‘bah and rulership over Makkah after his death.\nThe Third: \tHalil gave the right of Al- Ka‘bah service to his daughter Hobba and\nappointed Abu Ghabshan Al- Khuza‘i to function as her agent whereof. Upon Halil’s\ndeath, Qusai bought this right for a leather bag of wine, which aroused\ndissatisfaction among the men of Khuza‘a and they tried to keep the custodianship of\nthe Sacred House away from Qusai. The latter, however, with the help of Quraish\nand Kinana, managed to take over and even to expel Khuza‘a completely from\nMakkah. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/55]\nWhatever the truth might have been, the whole affair resulted in the deprivation of\nSofa of their privileges, previously mentioned, evacuation of Khuza‘a and Bakr from\nMakkah and transfer of rulership over Makkah and custodianship of the Holy\nSanctuary to Qusai, after fierce wars between Qusai and Khuza‘a inflicting heavy\ncasualties on both sides, reconciliation and then arbitration of Ya‘mur bin ‘Awf, from\nthe tribe of Bakr, whose judgement entailed eligibility of Qusai’s rulership over\n\n-- 18 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n19\nMakkah and custodianship of the Sacred House, Qusai’s irresponsibility for Khuza‘a’s\nblood shed, and imposition of blood money on Khuza‘a. Qusai’s reign over Makkah\nand the Sacred House began in 440 A.D. and allowed him, and Quraish afterwards,\nabsolute rulership over Makkah and undisputed custodianship of the Sacred House to\nwhich Arabs from all over Arabia came to pay homage.\nQusai brought his kinspeople to Makkah and allocated it to them, allowing Quraish\nsome dwellings there. An- Nus’a, the families of Safwan, Adwan, Murra bin ‘Awf\npreserved the same rights they used to enjoy before his arrival. [Ibn Hisham 1/124]\nA significant achievement credited to Qusai was the establishment of An- Nadwa\nHouse (an assembly house) on the northern side of Al- Ka‘bah Mosque, to serve as a\nmeeting place for Quraish. This very house had benefited Quraish a lot because it\nsecured unity of opinions amongst them and cordial solution to their problem. [Ibn\nHisham 1/125; Akhbar Al- Kiram p.152]\nQusai however enjoyed the following privileges of leadership and honour:\n1. \tPresiding over An- Nadwa House meetings where consultations relating to\nserious issues were conducted, and marriage contracts were announced.\n2. \tThe Standard: He monopolized in his hand issues relevant to war launching.\n3. \tDoorkeeping of Al- Ka‘bah: He was the only one eligible to open its gate, and\nwas responsible for its service and protection.\n4. \tProviding water for the Pilgrims: This means that he used to fill basins\nsweetened by dates and raisins for the pilgrims to drink.\n5. \tFeeding Pilgrims: This means making food for pilgrims who could not afford it.\nQusai even imposed on Quraish annual land tax, paid at the season of\npilgrimage, for food. [Ibn Hisham 1/130]\nIt is noteworthy however that Qusai singled out ‘Abd Manaf, a son of his, for honour\nand prestige though he was not his elder son (‘Abd Ad- Dar was), and entrusted him\nwith such responsibilities as chairing of An- Nadwa House, the standard, the\ndoorkeeping of Al- Ka‘bah, providing water and food for pilgrims. Due to the fact that\nQusai’s deeds were regarded as unquestionable and his orders inviolable, his death\ngave no rise to conflicts among his sons, but it later did among his grand children,\nfor no sooner than ‘Abd Munaf had died, his sons began to have rows with their\ncousins —sons of ‘Abd Ad- Dar, which would have given rise to dissension and\nfighting among the whole tribe of Quraish, had it not been for a peace treaty\nwhereby posts were reallocated so as to preserve feeding and providing water for\npilgrims for the sons of ‘Abd Munaf; while An- Nadwa House, the flag and the\ndoorkeeping of Al- Ka‘bah were maintained for the sons of ‘Abd Ad- Dar. The sons of\n‘Abd Munaf, however, cast the lot for their charge, and consequently left the charge\nof food and water giving to Hashim bin ‘Abd Munaf, upon whose death, the charge\nwas taken over by a brother of his called Al- Muttalib bin ‘Abd Manaf and afterwards\nby ‘Abd Al- Muttalib bin Hashim, the Prophet’s grandfather, whose sons assumed this\nposition until the rise of Islam, during which ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib was in\ncharge. [Ibn Hisham 1/129- 179]\n\n-- 19 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n20\nMany other posts were distributed among people of Quraish for establishing the\npillars of a new democratic petite state with government offices and councils similar\nto those of today. Enlisted as follows are some of these posts.\n1. \tCasting the lots for the idols was allocated to Bani Jumah.\n2. \tNoting of offers and sacrifices, settlement of disputes and relevant issues\nwere to lie in the hands of Bani Sahm.\n3. \tConsultation was to go to Bani Asad.\n4. \tOrganization of blood- money and fines was with Bani Tayim.\n5. \tBearing the national banner was with Bani Omaiyah.\n6. \tThe military institute, footmen and cavalry would be Bani Makhzum’s\nresponsibility.\n7. \tBani ‘Adi would function as foreign mediators. [Tareekh Ard Al- Qur'an 2/104-\n106]\nRulership in Pan-Arabia\nWe have previously mentioned the Qahtanide and ‘Adnanide emigrations, and\ndivision of Arabia between these two tribes. Those tribes dwelling near Heerah were\nsubordinate to the Arabian king of Heerah, while those dwelling in the Syrian semi-\ndesert were under domain of the Arabian Ghassanide king, a sort of dependency that\nwas in reality formal rather than actual. However, those living in the hinder deserts\nenjoyed full autonomy.\nThese tribes in fact had heads chosen by the whole tribe which was a demi-\ngovernment based on tribal solidarity and collective interests in defence of land and\nproperty.\nHeads of tribes enjoyed dictatorial privileges similar to those of kings, and were\nrendered full obedience and subordination in both war and peace. Rivalry among\ncousins for rulership, however, often drove them to outdo one another in\nentertaining guests, affecting generosity, wisdom and chivalry for the sole purpose of\noutranking their rivals, and gaining fame among people especially poets who were\nthe official spokesmen at the time.\nHeads of tribes and masters had special claims to spoils of war such as the quarter of\nthe spoils, whatever he chose for himself, or found on his way back or even the\nremaining indivisible spoils.\nThe Political Situation\nThe three Arab regions adjacent to foreigners suffered great weakness and\ninferiority. The people there were either masters or slaves, rulers or subordinates.\nMasters, especially the foreigners, had claim to every advantage; slaves had nothing\nbut responsibilities to shoulder. In other words, arbitrary autocratic rulership brought\nabout encroachment on the rights of subordinates, ignorance, oppression, iniquity,\ninjustice and hardship, and turning them into people groping in darkness and\nignorance, viz., fertile land which rendered its fruits to the rulers and men of power\nto extravagantly dissipate on their pleasures and enjoyments, whims and desires,\ntyranny and aggression. The tribes living near these regions were fluctuating\n\n-- 20 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n21\nbetween Syria and Iraq, whereas those living inside Arabia were disunited and\ngoverned by tribal conflicts and racial and religious disputes.\nThey had neither a king to sustain their independence nor a supporter to seek advice\nfrom, or depend upon, in hardships.\nThe rulers of Hijaz, however, were greatly esteemed and respected by the Arabs,\nand were considered as rulers and servants of the religious centre. Rulership of Hijaz\nwas, in fact, a mixture of secular and official precedence as well as religious\nleadership. They ruled among the Arabs in the name of religious leadership and\nalways monopolized the custodianship of the Holy Sanctuary and its neighbourhood.\nThey looked after the interests of Al- Ka‘bah visitors and were in charge of putting\nAbraham’s code into effect. They even had such offices and departments like those\nof the parliaments of today. However, they were too weak to carry the heavy\nburden, as this evidently came to light during the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) invasion.\n\n-- 21 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n22\nReligions of the Arabs\nMost of the Arabs had complied with the call of Ishmael [AWS] , and professed the\nreligion of his father Abraham [AWS] . They had worshipped All? \t, professed His\nOneness and followed His religion a long time until they forgot part of what they had\nbeen reminded of. However, they still maintained such fundamental beliefs such as\nm onotheism as well as various other aspects of Abraham’s religion, until the time\nwhen a chief of Khuza‘a, namely ‘Amr bin Luhai, who was renowned for\nrighteousness, charity, reverence and care for religion, and was granted unreserved\nlove and obedience by his tribesmen, came back from a trip to Syria where he saw\npeople worship idols, a phenomenon he approved of and believed it to be righteous\nsince Syria was the locus of Messengers and Scriptures, he brought with him an idol\n(Hubal) which he placed in the middle of Al- Ka‘bah and summoned people to worship\nit. Readily enough, paganism spread all over Makkah and, thence, to Hijaz, people of\nMakkah being custodians of not only the Sacred House but the whole Haram as well.\nA great many idols, bearing different names, were introduced into the area.\n[Mukhtasar Seerat- ar- Rasool p.12]\nAn idol called ‘Manat’, for instance, was worshipped in a place known as Al- Mushallal\nnear Qadid on the Red Sea. Another, ‘Al- Lat’ in Ta’if, a third, ‘Al- ‘Uzza’ in the valley\nof Nakhlah, and so on and so forth. Polytheism prevailed and the number of idols\nincreased everywhere in Hijaz. It was even mentioned that ‘Amr bin Luhai, with the\nhelp of a jinn companion who told him that the idols of Noah’s folk – Wadd, Suwa‘,\nYaguth, Ya‘uk and Nasr – were buried in Jeddah, dug them out and took them to\nTihama. Upon pilgrimage time, the idols were distributed among the tribes to take\nback home. [Bukhari 1/222] Every tribe, and house, had their own idols, and the\nSacred House was also overcrowded with them. On the Prophet’s conquest of\nMakkah, 360 idols were found around Al- Ka‘bah. He broke them down and had them\nremoved and burned up. [Mukhtasar Seerat- ar- Rasool p.13- 54]\nPolytheism and worship of idols became the most prominent feature of the religion of\npre- Islam Arabs despite alleged profession of Abraham’s religion.\nTraditions and ceremonies of the worship of their idols had been mostly created by\n‘Amr bin Luhai, and were deemed as good innovations rather than deviations from\nAbraham’s religion. Some features of their worship of idols were:\n1. \tSelf- devotion to the idols, seeking refuge with them, acclamation of their\nnames, calling for their help in hardship, and supplication to them for\nfulfillment of wishes, hopefully that the idols (i.e., heathen gods) would\nmediate with All? \tfor the fulfillment of people’s wishes.\n2. \tPerforming pilgrimage to the idols, circumrotation round them, self-\nabasement and even prostrating themselves before them.\n3. \tSeeking favour of idols through various kinds of sacrifices and immolations,\nwhich is mentioned in the Qur’? \tic verses:\n\"And that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An- Nusub (stone-\naltars)\" \t[Al- Qur'an 5:3]\nAll? \talso says:\n\n-- 22 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n23\n\"Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which All? \t’s Name has not\nbeen pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal).\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 6:121]\n4. \tConsecration of certain portions of food, drink, cattle, and crops to idols.\nSurprisingly enough, portions were also consecrated to All? \tHimself, but\npeople often found reasons to transfer parts of All? \t’s portion to idols, but\nnever did the opposite. To this effect, the Qur’? \tic verses go:\n\"And they assign to All? \ta share of the tilth and cattle which He has\ncreated, and they say: ‘This is for All? \taccording to their pretending, and\nthis is for our (All? \t’s so- called) partners.’ But the share of their (All? \t’s so-\ncalled) ‘partners’, reaches not All? \t, while the share of All? \treaches their\n(All? \t’s so- called) ‘partners’. Evil is the way they judge.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 6:136]\n5. \tCurrying favours with these idols through votive offerings of crops and cattle,\nto which effect, the Qur’? \tgoes:\n\"And according to their pretending, they say that such and such cattle and\ncrops are forbidden, and none should eat of them except those whom we\nallow. And (they say) there are cattle forbidden to be used for burden or\nany other work, and cattle on which (at slaughtering) the Name of All? \tis\nnot pronounced; lying against Him (All? \t).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 6:138]\n6. \tDedication of certain animals (such as \tBahira, \tSa’iba, \tWasila \tand \tHami) to\nidols, which meant sparing such animals from useful work for the sake of\nthese heathen gods. \tBahira, as reported by the well- known historian, Ibn\nIshaq, was daughter of \tSa’iba \twhich was a female camel that gave birth to\nten successive female animals, but no male ones, was set free and forbidden\nto yoke, burden or being sheared off its wool, or milked (but for guests to\ndrink from); and so was done to all her female offspring which were given the\nname ‘Bahira’, after having their ears slit. The \tWasila \twas a female sheep\nwhich had ten successive female daughters in five pregnancies. Any new\nbirths from this \tWasila \twere assigned only for male people. The \tHami \twas a\nmale camel which produced ten progressive females, and was thus similarly\nforbidden. In mention of this, the Qur’? \tic verses go:\n\"All? \thas not instituted things like \tBahira \t( a she- camel whose milk was\nspared for the idols and nobody was allowed to milk it) or a \tSa’iba \t(a she\ncamel let loose for free pasture for their false gods, e.g. idols, etc., and\nnothing was allowed to be carried on it), or a \tWasila \t(a she- camel set free\nfor idols because it has given birth to a she- camel at its first delivery and\nthen again gives birth to a she- camel at its second delivery) or a \tH \t? \t(a\nstallion- camel freed from work for their idols, after it had finished a number\nof copulations assigned for it, all these animals were liberated in honour of\nidols as practised by pagan Arabs in the pre- Islamic period). But those who\ndisbelieve, invent lies against All? \t, and most of them have no\nunderstanding.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 5:103]\nAll? \talso says:\n\n-- 23 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n24\n\"And they say: What is in the bellies of such and such cattle (milk or foetus)\nis for our males alone, and forbidden to our females (girls and women), but\nif it is born dead, then all have shares therein.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 6:139]\nIt has been authentically reported that such superstitions were first invented by ‘Amr\nbin Luhai. [Bukhari 1/499]\nThe Arabs believed that such idols, or heathen gods, would bring them nearer to\nAll? \t, lead them to Him, and mediate with Him for their sake, to which effect, the\nQur’? \tgoes:\n\"We worship them only that they may bring us near to All? \t.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 39:3]\nand\n\"And they worship besides All? \tthings that hurt them not, nor profit them,\nand they say: These are our intercessors with All? \t.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 10:18]\nAnother divinatory tradition among the Arabs was casting of \tAzlam \t(i.e. featherless\narrows which were of three kinds: one showing ‘yes’, another ‘no’ and a third was\nblank) which they used to do in case of serious matters like travel, marriage and the\nlike. If the lot showed ‘yes’, they would do, if ‘no’, they would delay for the next\nyear. Other kinds of \tAzlam \twere cast for water, blood- money or showed ‘from you’,\n‘not from you’, or ‘Mulsaq’ (consociated). In cases of doubt in filiation they would\nresort to the idol of Hubal, with a hundred- camel gift, for the arrow caster. Only the\narrows would then decide the sort of relationship. If the arrow showed (from you),\nthen it was decided that the child belonged to the tribe; if it showed (from others),\nhe would then be regarded as an ally, but if (consociated) appeared, the person\nwould retain his position but with no lineage or alliance contract. [Muhadrat Tareekh\nAl- Umam Al- Islamiyah 1/56; Ibn Hisham 1/152,153]\nThis was very much like gambling and arrow- shafting whereby they used to divide\nthe meat of the camels they slaughtered according to this tradition.\nMoreover, they used to have a deep conviction in the tidings of soothsayers, diviners\nand astrologers. A soothsayer used to traffic in the business of foretelling future\nevents and claim knowledge of private secrets and having jinn subordinates who\nwould communicate the news to him. Some soothsayers claimed that they could\nuncover the unknown by means of a granted power, while other diviners boasted\nthey could divulge the secrets through a cause- and- effect- inductive process that\nwould lead to detecting a stolen commodity, location of a theft, a stray animal, and\nthe like. The astrologer belonged to a third category who used to observe the stars\nand calculate their movements and orbits whereby he would foretell the future.\n[Mirqat Al- Mafateeh 2/2,3] \tLending credence to this news constituted a clue to their\nconviction that attached special significance to the movements of particular stars\nwith regard to rainfall. [Muslim with An- Nawawi 1/59]\nThe belief in signs as betokening future events, was, of course common among the\nArabians. Some days and months and particular animals were regarded as ominous.\nThey also believed that the soul of a murdered person would fly in the wilderness\nand would never rest at rest until revenge was taken. Superstition was rampant.\n\n-- 24 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n25\nShould a deer or bird, when released, turn right then what they embarked on would\nbe regarded auspicious, otherwise they would get pessimistic and withhold from\npursuing it. [Bukhari with footnotes of Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri 2/851,857]\nPeople of pre- Islamic period, whilst believing in superstition, they still retained some\nof the Abrahamic traditions such as devotion to the Holy Sanctuary,\ncircumambulation, observance of pilgrimage, the vigil on ‘Arafah and offering\nsacrifices, all of these were observed fully despite some innovations that adulterated\nthese holy rituals. Quraish, for example, out of arrogance, feeling of superiority to\nother tribes and pride in their custodianship of the Sacred House, would refrain from\ngoing to ‘Arafah with the crowd, instead they would stop short at Muzdalifah. The\nNoble Qur’? \trebuked and told them:\n\"Then depart from the place whence all the people depart.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 2:199]\n[Ibn Hisham 1/199; Bukhari 1/226]\nAnother heresy, deeply established in their social tradition, dictated that they would\nnot eat dried yoghurt or cooked fat, nor would they enter a tent made of camel hair\nor seek shade unless in a house of adobe bricks, so long as they were committed to\nthe intention of pilgrimage. They also, out of a deeply- rooted misconception, denied\npilgrims, other than Makkans, access to the food they had brought when they\nwanted to make pilgrimage or lesser pilgrimage.\nThey ordered pilgrims coming from outside Makkah to circumambulate Al- Ka‘bah in\nQuraish uniform clothes, but if they could not afford them, men were to do so in a\nstate of nudity, and women with only some piece of cloth to hide their groins. All?\nsays in this concern:\n\"O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes),\nwhile praying [and going round (the \tTawaf \tof) the Ka‘bah]. \t[Al- Qur'an 7:31]\nIf men or women were generous enough to go round Al- Ka‘bah in their clothes, they\nhad to discard them after circumambulation for good. [Bukhari 1/226; Ibn Hisham\n1/202]\nWhen the Makkans were in a pilgrimage consecration state, they would not enter\ntheir houses through the doors but through holes they used to dig in the back walls.\nThey used to regard such behaviour as deeds of piety and god- fearing. This practice\nwas prohibited by the Qur’? \t:\n\"It is not \tAl- Birr \t(piety, righteousness, etc.) t",
  "hat you enter the houses from\nthe back but \tAl- Birr \t(is the quality of the one) who fears All? \t. So enter\nhouses through their proper doors, and fear All? \tthat you may be\nsuccessful.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 2:189]\nSuch was the religious life in Arabia, polytheism, idolatry, and superstition.\nJudaism, Christianity, Magianism and Sabianism, however, could find their ways\neasily into Arabia.\n\n-- 25 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n26\nThe migration of the Jews from Palestine to Arabia passed through two phases: first,\nas a result of the pressure to which they were exposed, the destruction of the their\ntemple, and taking most of them as captives to Babylon, at the hand of the King\nBukhtanassar. In the year B.C. 587 some Jews left Palestine for Hijaz and settled in\nthe northern areas whereof. The second phase started with the Roman occupation of\nPalestine under the leadership of Roman Buts in 70 A.D. This resulted in a tidal wave\nof Jewish migration into Hijaz, and Yathrib, Khaibar and Taima’, in particular. Here,\nthey made proselytes of several tribes, built forts and castles, and lived in villages.\nJudaism managed to play an important role in the pre- Islam political life. When\nIslam dawned on that land, there had already been several famous Jewish tribes —\nKhabeer, Al- Mustaliq, An- Nadeer, Quraizah and Qainuqa‘. In some versions, the\nJewish tribes counted as many as twenty. [Qalb Jazeerat Al- Arab, p.151]\nJudaism was introduced into Yemen by someone called As‘ad Abi Karb. He had gone\nto fight in Yathrib and there he embraced Judaism and then went back taking with\nhim two rabbis from Bani Quraizah to instruct the people of Yemen in this new\nreligion. Judaism found a fertile soil there to propagate and gain adherents. After his\ndeath, his son Yusuf Dhu Nawas rose to power, attacked the Christian community in\nNajran and ordered them to embrace Judaism. When they refused, he ordered that a\npit of fire be dug and all the Christians indiscriminately be dropped to burn therein.\nEstimates say that between 20- 40 thousand Christians were killed in that human\nmassacre. The Qur’? \trelated part of that story in \tAl- Buruj \t(zodiacal signs) Chapter.\n[Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 6/297; Ibn Hisham 1/20- 36]\nChristianity had first made its appearance in Arabia following the entry of the\nAbyssinian (Ethiopian) and Roman colonists into that country. The Abyssinian\n(Ethiopian) colonization forces in league with Christian missions entered Yemen as a\nretaliatory reaction for the iniquities of Dhu Nawas, and started vehemently to\npropagate their faith ardently. They even built a church and called it Yemeni Al-\nKa‘bah with the aim of directing the Arab pilgrimage caravans towards Yemen, and\nthen made an attempt to demolish the Sacred House in Makkah. All? \t, the Almighty,\nhowever did punish them and made an example of them – here and hereafter.\n[Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 6/297; Ibn Hisham 1/20- 36]\nA Christian missionary called Fimion, and known for his ascetic behaviour and\nworking miracles, had likewise infiltrated into Najran. There he called people to\nChristianity, and by virtue of his honesty and truthful devotion, he managed to\npersuade them to respond positively to his invitation and embrace Christianity.\nThe principal tribes that embraced Christianity were Ghassan, Taghlib, Tai’ and some\nHimyarite kings as well as other tribes living on the borders of the Roman Empire.\nMagianism was also popular among the Arabs living in the neighbourhood of Persia,\nIraq, Bahrain, Al- Ahs?#146; and some areas on the Arabian Gulf coast. Some\nYemenis are also reported to have professed Magianism during the Persian\noccupation.\nAs for Sabianism, excavations in Iraq revealed that it had been popular amongst\nKaldanian folks, the Syrians and Yemenis. With the advent of Judaism and\nChristianity, however, Sabianism began to give way to the new religions, although it\nretained some followers mixed or adjacent to the Magians in Iraq and the Arabian\nGulf. [Tareekh Ard Al- Qur'an 2/193- 208]\n\n-- 26 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n27\nThe Religious Situation\nSuch was the religious life of the Arabians before the advent of Islam. The role that\nthe religions prevalent played was so marginal, in fact it was next to nothing. The\npolytheists, who faked Abrahamism, were so far detached from its precepts, and\ntotally oblivious of its immanent good manners. They plunged into disobedience and\nungodliness, and developed certain peculiar religious superstitions that managed to\nleave a serious impact on the religious and socio- political life in the whole of Arabia.\nJudaism turned into abominable hypocrisy in league with hegemony. Rabbis turned\ninto lords to the exclusion of the Lord. They got involved in the practice of dictatorial\nsubjection of people and calling their subordinates to account for the least word or\nidea. Their sole target turned into acquisition of wealth and power even if it were at\nthe risk of losing their religion, or the emergence of atheism and disbelief.\nChristianity likewise opened its doors wide to polytheism, and got too difficult to\ncomprehend as a heavenly religion. As a religious practice, it developed a sort of\npeculiar medley of man and God. It exercised no bearing whatsoever on the souls of\nthe Arabs who professed it simply because it was alien to their style of life and did\nnot have the least relationship with their practical life.\nPeople of other religions were similar to the polytheists with respect to their\ninclinations, dogmas, customs and traditions.\n\n-- 27 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n28\nAspects of Pre-Islamic Arabian Society\nAfter the research we have made into the religious and political life of Arabia, it is\nappropriate to speak briefly about the social, economic and ethical conditions\nprevalent therein.\nSocial Life of the Arabs\nThe Arabian Society presented a social medley, with different and heterogeneous\nsocial strata. The status of the woman among the nobility recorded an advanced\ndegree of esteem. The woman enjoyed a considerable portion of free will, and her\ndecision would most often be enforced. She was so highly cherished that blood would\nbe easily shed in defence of her honour. In fact, she was the most decisive key to\nbloody fight or friendly peace. These privileges notwithstanding, the family system in\nArabia was wholly patriarchal. The marriage contract rested completely in the hands\nof the woman’s legal guardian whose words with regard to her marital status could\nnever be questioned.\nOn the other hand, there were other social strata where prostitution and indecency\nwere rampant and in full operation. Abu Da’? , on the authority of ‘Aishah [R]\nreported four kinds of marriage in pre- Islamic Arabia: The first was similar to\npresent- day marriage procedures, in which case a man gives his daughter in\nmarriage to another man after a dowry has been agreed on. In the second, the\nhusband would send his wife – after the menstruation period – to cohabit with\nanother man in order to conceive. After conception her husband would, if he desired,\nhave a sexual intercourse with her. A third kind was that a group of less than ten\nmen would have sexual intercourse with a woman. If she conceived and gave birth to\na child, she would send for these men, and nobody could abstain. They would come\ntogether to her house. She would say: ‘You know what you have done. I have given\nbirth to a child and it is your child’ (pointing to one of them). The man meant would\nhave to accept. The fourth kind was that a lot of men would have sexual intercourse\nwith a certain woman (a whore). She would not prevent anybody. Such women used\nto put a certain flag at their gates to invite in anyone who liked. If this whore got\npregnant and gave birth to a child, she would collect those men, and a seeress would\ntell whose child it was. The appointed father would take the child and declare\nhim/her his own. When Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] declared Islam in Arabia, he\ncancelled all these forms of sexual contacts except that of present Islamic marriage.\n[Abu Da'ud - The Book of marriage]\nWomen always accompanied men in their wars. The winners would freely have\nsexual intercourse with such women, but disgrace would follow the children\nconceived in this way all their lives.\nPre- Islam Arabs had no limited number of wives. They could marry two sisters at the\nsame time, or even the wives of their fathers if divorced or widowed. Divorce was to\na very great extent in the power of the husband. [Abu Da'ud - The Book of marriage]\nThe obscenity of adultery prevailed almost among all social classes except few men\nand women whose self- dignity prevented them from committing such an act. Free\nwomen were in much better conditions than the female slaves who constituted the\ngreatest calamity. It seemed that the greatest majority of pre- Islam Arabs did not\n\n-- 28 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n29\nfeel ashamed of committing this obscenity. Abu Da’? \treported: A man stood up in\nfront of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] and said: \"O Prophet of All? \t! that boy is my son.\nI had sexual intercourse with his mother in the pre- Islamic period.\" The Prophet\n[pbuh] said:\n\"No claim in Islam for pre- Islamic affairs. The child is to be attributed to the\none on whose bed it was born, and stoning is the lot of a fornicator.\" \t[Abu\nDa'ud - Chapter \"The child is to the one on whose bed it was born]\nWith respect to the pre- Islam Arab’s relation with his offspring, we see that life in\nArabia was paradoxical and presented a gloomy picture of contrasts. Whilst some\nArabs held children dear to their hearts and cherished them greatly, others buried\ntheir female children alive because an illusory fear of poverty and shame weighed\nheavily on them. The practice of infanticide cannot, however, be seen as irrevocably\nrampant because of their dire need for male children to guard themselves against\ntheir enemies.\nAnother aspect of the Arabs’ life which deserves mention is the bedouin’s deep-\nseated emotional attachment to his clan. Family, or perhaps tribal- pride, was one of\nthe strongest passions with him. The doctrine of unity of blood as the principle that\nbound the Arabs into a social unity was formed and supported by tribal- pride. Their\nundisputed motto was: \"Support your brother whether he is an oppressor or\noppressed\" in its literal meaning; they disregarded the Islamic amendment which\nstates that supporting an oppressor brother implies deterring him from\ntransgression.\nAvarice for leadership, and keen sense of emulation often resulted in bitter tribal\nwarfare despite descendency from one common ancestor. In this regard, the\ncontinued bloody conflicts of Aws and Khazraj, ‘Abs and Dhubyan, Bakr and Taghlib,\netc. are striking examples.\nInter- tribal relationships were fragile and weak due to continual inter- tribal wars of\nattrition. Deep devotion to religious superstitions and some customs held in\nveneration, however, used to curb their impetuous tendency to quench their thirst\nfor blood. In other cases, there were the motives of, and respect for, alliance, loyalty\nand dependency which could successfully bring about a spirit of rapport, and abort\ngroundless bases of dispute. A time- honoured custom of suspending hostilities\nduring the prohibited months (Muharram, Rajab, Dhul- Qa‘dah, and Dhul- Hijjah)\nfunctioned favourably and provided an opportunity for them to earn their living and\ncoexist in peace.\nWe may sum up the social situation in Arabia by saying that the Arabs of the pre-\nIslamic period were groping about in the dark and ignorance, entangled in a mesh of\nsuperstitions paralyzing their mind and driving them to lead an animal- like life. The\nwoman was a marketable commodity and regarded as a piece of inanimate property.\nInter- tribal relationships were fragile. Avarice for wealth and involvement in futile\nwars were the main objectives that governed their chiefs’ self- centred policies.\nThe Economic Situation\n\n-- 29 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n29\nThe economic situation ran in line with the social atmosphere. The Arabian ways of\nliving would illustrate this phenomenon quite clearly. Trade was the most common\nmeans of providing their needs of life. The trade journeys could not be fulfilled unless\nsecurity of caravan routes and inter- tribal peaceful co- existence were provided – two\nimperative exigencies unfortunately lacking in Arabia except during the prohibited\nmonths within which the Arabs held their assemblies of ‘Ukaz, Dhil- Majaz, Mijannah\nand others.\nIndustry was alien to the Arabian psychology. Most of available industries of knitting\nand tannage in Arabia were done by people coming from Yemen, Heerah and the\nborders of Syria. Inside Arabia there was some sort of farming and stock- breeding.\nAlmost all the Arabian women worked in yarn spinning but even this practice was\ncontinually threatened by wars. On the whole, poverty, hunger and insufficient\nclothing were the prevailing features in Arabia, economically.\nEthics\nWe cannot deny that the pre- Islam Arabs had such a large bulk of evils. Admittedly,\nvices and evils, utterly rejected by reason, were rampant amongst the pre- Islam\nArabs, but this could never screen off the surprise- provoking existence of highly\npraiseworthy virtues, of which we could adduce the following:\n1. \tHospitality: \tThey used to emulate one another at hospitality and take\nutmost pride in it. Almost half of their poetry heritage was dedicated to the\nmerits and nobility attached to entertaining one’s guest. They were generous\nand hospitable on the point of fault. They would sacrifice their private\nsustenance to a cold or hungry guest. They would not hesitate to incur heavy\nblood- money and relevant burdens just to stop blood- shed, and consequently\nmerit praise and eulogy.\nIn the context of hospitality, there springs up their common habits of drinking\nwine which was regarded as a channel branching out of generosity and\nshowing hospitality. Wine drinking was a genuine source of pride for the\nArabs of the pre- Islamic period. The great poets of that era never forgot to\ninclude their suspending odes the most ornate lines pregnant with boasting\nand praise of drinking orgies. Even the word ‘grapes’ in Arabic is identical to\ngenerosity in both pronunciation and spelling. Gambling was also another\npractice of theirs closely associated with generosity since the proceeds would\nalways go to charity. Even the Noble Qur’? \tdoes not play down the benefits\nthat derive from wine drinking and gambling, but also says,\n\"And the sin of them is greater than their benefit.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 2:219]\n2. \tKeeping a covenant: \tFor the Arab, to make a promise was to run into debt.\nHe would never grudge the death of his children or destruction of his\nhousehold just to uphold the deep- rooted tradition of covenant- keeping. The\nliterature of that period is rich in stories highlighting this merit.\n3. \tSense of honour and repudiation of injustice: \tThis attribute stemmed\nmainly from excess courage, keen sense of self- esteem and impetuosity. The\nArab was always in revolt against the least allusion to humiliation or\n\n-- 30 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n31\nslackness. He would never hesitate to sacrifice himself to maintain his ever\nalert sense of self- respect.\n4. \tFirm will and determination: \tAn Arab would never desist an avenue\nconducive to an object of pride or a standing of honour, even if it were at the\nexpense of his life.\n5. \tForbearance, perseverance and mildness: \tThe Arab regarded these traits\nwith great admiration, no wonder, his impetuosity and courage- based life was\nsadly wanting in them.\n6. \tPure and simple bedouin life, \tstill untarnished with accessories of\ndeceptive urban appearances, was a driving reason to his nature of\ntruthfulness and honesty, and detachment from intrigue and treachery.\nSuch priceless ethics coupled with a favourable geographical position of Arabia were\nin fact the factors that lay behind selecting the Arabs to undertake the burden of\ncommunicating the Message (of Islam) and leading mankind down a new course of\nlife.\nIn this regard, these ethics per se, though detrimental in some areas, and in need of\nrectification in certain aspects, were greatly invaluable to the ultimate welfare of the\nhuman community and Islam has did it completely.\nThe most priceless ethics, next to covenant- keeping, were no doubt their sense of\nself- esteem and strong determination, two human traits indispensable in combatting\nevil and eliminating moral corruption on the one hand, and establishing a good and\njustice- orientated society, on the other.\nActually, the life of the Arabs in the pre- Islamic period was rich in other countless\nvirtues we do not need to enumerate for the time being.\n\n-- 31 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n32\nThe Lineage and Family of Muhammad [pbuh]\nWith respect to the lineage of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], there are three versions:\nThe first was authenticated by biographers and genealogists and states that\nMuhammad’s genealogy has been traced to ‘Adnan. The second is subject to\ncontroversies and doubt, and traces his lineage beyond ‘Adnan back to Abraham. The\nthird version, with some parts definitely incorrect, traces his lineage beyond\nAbraham back to Adam [AWS].\nAfter this rapid review, now ample details are believed to be necessary.\nThe first part: Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib (who was called Shaiba)\nbin Hashim, (named ‘Amr) bin ‘Abd Munaf (called Al- Mugheera) bin Qusai (also called\nZaid) bin Kilab bin Murra bin Ka‘b bin Lo’i bin Ghalib bin Fahr (who was called\nQuraish and whose tribe was called after him) bin Malik bin An- Nadr (so called Qais)\nbin Kinana bin Khuzaiman bin Mudrikah (who was called ‘Amir) bin Elias bin Mudar\nbin Nizar bin Ma‘ad bin ‘Adnan. [Ibn Hisham 1/1,2; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al- Athar, p.\n5- 6; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/11- 14,52]\nThe second part: ‘Adnan bin Add bin Humaisi‘ bin Salaman bin Aws bin Buz bin\nQamwal bin Obai bin ‘Awwam bin Nashid bin Haza bin Bildas bin Yadlaf bin Tabikh\nbin Jahim bin Nahish bin Makhi bin Aid bin ‘Abqar bin ‘Ubaid bin Ad- Da‘a bin Hamdan\nbin Sanbir bin Yathrabi bin Yahzin bin Yalhan bin Ar‘awi bin Aid bin Deshan bin Aisar\nbin Afnad bin Aiham bin Muksar bin Nahith bin Zarih bin Sami bin Mazzi bin ‘Awda\nbin Aram bin Qaidar bin Ishmael son of Abraham [AWS]. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen\n2/14- 17]\nThe third part: beyond Abraham [AWS] , Ibn Tarih (Azar) bin Nahur bin Saru‘ bin\nRa‘u bin Falikh bin Abir bin Shalikh bin Arfakhshad bin Sam bin Noah [AWS] , bin\nLamik bin Mutwashlack bin Akhnukh [who was said to be Prophet Idris (Enoch)\n[AWS]] bin Yarid bin Mahla’il bin Qainan bin Anusha bin Shith bin Adam [AWS]. [Ibn\nHisham 1/2- 4; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/18; Khulasat As- Siyar p.6]\nThe Prophetic Family\nThe family of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] is called the Hashimite family after his\ngrandfather Hashim bin ‘Abd Munaf. Let us now speak a little about Hashim and his\ndescendants:\n1. \tHashim: \tAs we have previously mentioned, he was the one responsible for\ngiving food and water to the pilgrims. This had been his charge when the sons\nof ‘Abd Munaf and those of ‘Abd Ad- Dar compromised on dividing the charges\nbetween them. Hashim was wealthy and honest. He was the first to offer the\npilgrims sopped bread in broth. His first name was ‘Amr but he was called\nHashim because he had been in the practice of crumbling bread (for the\npilgrims). He was also the first man who started Quraish’s two journeys of\nsummer and winter. It was reported that he went to Syria as a merchant. In\nMadinah, he married Salma — the daughter of ‘Amr from Bani ‘Adi bin An-\nNajjar. He spent some time with her in Madinah then he left for Syria again\nwhile she was pregnant. He died in Ghazza in Palestine in 497 A.D. Later, his\nwife gave birth to ‘Abdul- Muttalib and named him Shaiba for the white hair in\n\n-- 32 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n33\nhis head,[Ibn Hisham 1/137; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/26,2/24] and brought\nhim up in her father’s house in Madinah. None of his family in Makkah learned\nof his birth. Hashim had four sons; Asad, Abu Saifi, Nadla and ‘Abdul-\nMuttalib, and five daughters Ash- Shifa, Khalida, Da‘ifa, Ruqyah and\nJannah.[Ibn Hisham 1/107]\n2. \t‘Abdul- Muttalib: \tWe have already known that after the death of Hashim, the\ncharge of pilgrims’ food and water went to his brother Al- Muttalib bin ‘Abd\nMunaf (who was honest, generous and trustworthy). When ‘Abdul- Muttalib\nreached the age of boyhood, his uncle Al- Muttalib heard of him and went to\nMadinah to fetch him. When he saw him, tears filled his eyes and rolled down\nhis cheeks, he embraced him and took him on his camel. The boy, however\nabstained from going with him to Makkah until he took his mother’s consent.\nAl- Muttalib asked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused.\nHe managed to convince her saying: \"Your son is going to Makkah to restore\nhis father’s authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred House.\" There in\nMakkah, people wondered at seeing Abdul- Muttalib, and they considered him\nthe slave of Muttalib. Al- Muttalib said: \"He is my nephew, the son of my\nbrother Hashim.\" The boy was brought up in Al- Muttalib’s house, but later on\nAl- Muttalib died in Bardman in Yemen so ‘Abdul- Muttalib took over and\nmanaged to maintain his people’s prestige and outdo his grandfathers in his\nhonourable behaviour which gained him Makkah’s deep love and high esteem.\n[Ibn Hisham 1/137,138]\nWhen Al- Muttalib died, Nawfal usurped ‘Abdul- Muttalib of his charges, so the\nlatter asked for help from Quraish but they abstained from extending any sort\nof support to either of them. Consequently, he wrote to his uncles of Bani An-\nNajjar (his mother’s brothers) to come to his aid. His uncle, Abu Sa‘d bin ‘Adi\n(his mother’s brother) marched to Makkah at the head of eighty horsemen\nand camped in Abtah in Makkah. ‘Abdul- Muttalib received the men and invited\nthem to go to his house but Abu Sa‘d said: \"Not before I meet Nawfal.\" He\nfound Nawfal sitting with some old men of Quraish in the shade of Al- Ka‘bah.\nAbu Sa‘d drew his sword and said: \"I swear by All? \tthat if you don’t restore\nto my nephew what you have taken, I will kill you with this sword.\" Nawfal\nwas thus forced to give up what he had usurped, and the notables of Quraish\nwere made to witness to his words. Abu Sa‘d then went to ‘Abdul- Muttalib’s\nhouse where he stayed for three nights, made \t‘Umra \tand left back for\nMadinah. Later on, Nawfal entered into alliance with Bani ‘Abd Shams bin ‘Abd\nMunaf against Bani Hashim. When Khuza‘a, a tribe, saw Bani An- Najjar’s\nsupport to ‘Abdul- Muttalib they said: \"He is our son as he is yours. We have\nmore reasons to support him than you.\" ‘Abd Munaf’s mother was one of\nthem. They went into An- Nadwa House and entered into alliance with Bani\nHashim against Bani ‘Abd Shams and Nawfal. It was an alliance that was later\nto constitute the main reason for the conquest of Makkah. ‘Abdul- Muttalib\nwitnessed two important events in his lifetime, namely digging Zamzam well\nand the Elephant raid. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool, p.41,42; Ibn Hisham\n1/142- 147]\nIn brief, ‘Abdul- Muttalib received an order in his dream to dig Zamzam well in\na particular place. He did that and found the things that Jurhum men had\nburied therein when they were forced to evacuate Makkah. He found the\nswords, armours and the two deer of gold. The gate of Al- Ka‘bah was\nstamped from the gold swords and the two deer and then the tradition of\nproviding Zamzam water to pilgrims was established.\n\n-- 33 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n34\nWhen the well of Zamzam gushed water forth, Quraish made a claim to\npartnership in the enterprise, but ‘Abdul- Muttalib refused their demands on\ngrounds that All? \thad singled only him out for this honourable job. To settle\nthe dispute, they agreed to consult Bani Sa‘d’s diviner. On their way, All?\nshowed them His Signs that confirmed ‘Abdul- Muttalib’s prerogative as\nregards the sacred spring. Only then did ‘Abdul- Muttalib make a solemn vow\nto sacrifice one of his adult children to Al- Ka‘bah if he had ten.\nThe second event was that of Abraha As- Sabah Al- Habashi, the Abyssinian\n(Ethiopian) viceroy in Yemen. He had seen that the Arabs made their\npilgrimage to Al- Ka‘bah so he built a large church in San‘a in order to attract\nthe Arab pilgrims to it to the exclusion of Makkah. A man from Kinana tribe\nunderstood this move, therefore he entered the church stealthily at night and\nbesmeared its front wall with excrement. When Abraha knew of that, he got\nvery angry and led a great army – of sixty thousand warriors – to demolish\nAl- Ka‘bah. He chose the biggest elephant for himself. His army included nine\nor thirteen elephants. He continued marching until he reached a place called\nAl- Magmas. There, he mobilized his army, prepared his elephants and got\nready to enter Makkah. When he reached Muhassar Valley, between\nMuzdalifah and Mina, the elephant knelt down and refused to go forward.\nWhenever they directed it northwards, southwards or eastwards, the elephant\nmoved quickly but when directed westwards towards Al- Ka‘bah, it knelt down.\nMeanwhile, All? \tloosed upon them birds in flights, hurling against them\nstones of baked clay and made them like green blades devoured. These birds\nwere very much like swallows and sparrows, each carrying three stones; one\nin its peak and two in its claws. The stones hit Abraha’s men and cut their\nlimbs and killed them. A large number of Abraha’s soldiers were killed in this\nway and the others fled at random and died everywhere. Abraha himself had\nan infection that had his fingertips amputated. When he reached San‘a he was\nin a miserable state and died soon after.\nThe Quraishites on their part had fled for their lives to the hillocks and\nmountain tops. When the enemy had been thus routed, they returned home\nsafely. [Ibn Hisham 1/43- 56; Tafheemul- Qur'an 6/462- 469]\nThe Event of the Elephant took place in the month of Al- Muharram, fifty or\nfifty five days before the birth of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] which\ncorresponded to late February or early March 571 A.D. It was a gift from All?\nto His Prophet and his family. It could actually be regarded as a Divine\nauspicious precursor of the light to come and accompany the advent of the\nProphet and his family. By contrast, Jerusalem had suffered under the yoke of\nthe atrocities of All? \t’s enemies. Here we can recall Bukhtanassar in B.C. 587\nand the Romans in 70 A.D. Al- Ka‘bah, by Divine Grace, never came under the\nhold of the Christians – the Muslims of that time – although Makkah was\npopulated by polytheists.\nNews of the Elephant Event reached the most distant corners of the then\ncivilized world. Abyssinia (Ethiopia) maintained strong ties with the Romans,\nwhile the Persians on the other hand, were on the vigil with respect to any\nstrategic changes that were looming on the socio- political horizon, and soon\ncame to occupy Yemen. Incidentally, the Roman and Persian Empires stood\n\n-- 34 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n35\nfor the powerful civilized world at that time. The Elephant Raid Event riveted\nthe world’s attention to the sacredness of All? \t’s House, and showed that this\nHouse had been chosen by All? \tfor its holiness. It followed then if any of its\npeople claimed Prophethood, it would be congruous with the outcome of the\nElephant Event, and would provide a justifiable explanation for the ulterior\nDivine Wisdom that lay behind backing polytheists against Christians in a\nmanner that transcended the cause- and- effect formula.\n‘Abdul- Muttalib had ten sons, Al- Harith, Az- Zubair, Abu Talib, ‘Abdullah,\nHamzah, Abu Lahab, Ghidaq, Maqwam, Safar and Al- ‘Abbas. He also had six\ndaughters, who were Umm Al- Hakim – the only white one, Barrah, ‘Atikah,\nSafiya, Arwa and Omaima. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/56,66; Talqeeh Fuhoom\nAhl Al- Athar, p8,9]\n3. \t‘Abdullah: \tThe father of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]. His mother was\nFatimah, daughter of ‘Amr bin ‘A’idh bin ‘Imran bin Makhzum bin Yaqdha bin\nMurra. ‘Abdullah was the smartest of ‘Abdul- Muttalib’s sons, the chastest and\nthe most loved. He was also the son whom the divination arrows pointed at to\nbe slaughtered as a sacrifice to Al- Ka‘bah. When ‘Abdul- Muttalib had ten sons\nand they reached maturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they\nsilently and obediently acquiesced. Their names were written on divination\narrows and given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The\narrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be\nsacrificed. ‘Abdul- Muttalib then took the boy to Al- Ka‘bah with a razor to\nslaughter the boy. Quraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and his brother\nAbu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from consummating his purpose.\nHe then sought their advice as regards his vow. They suggested that he\nsummon a she- diviner to judge whereabout. She ordered that the divination\narrows should be drawn with respect to ‘Abdullah as well as ten camels. She\nadded that drawing the lots should be repeated with ten more camels every\ntime the arrow showed ‘Abdullah. The operation was thus repeated until the\nnumber of the camels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow\nshowed the camels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the\nsatisfaction of Hubal) instead of his son. The slaughtered camels were left for\nanyone to eat from, human or animal.\nThis incident produced a change in the amount of blood- money usually\naccepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was\nincreased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this. Another thing\nclosely relevant to the above issue goes to the effect that the Prophet [pbuh]\nonce said:\n\"I am the offspring of the slaughtered two,\" meaning Ishmael and ‘Abdullah.\n[Ibn Hisham 1/151- 155; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/89,90]\n‘Abdul- Muttalib chose Amina, daughter of Wahab bin ‘Abd Munaf bin Zahra bin\nKilab, as a wife for his son, ‘Abdullah. She thus, in the light of this ancestral\nlineage, stood eminent in respect of nobility of position and descent. Her\nfather was the chief of Bani Zahra to whom great honour was attributed. They\nwere mar",
  "ried in Makkah, and soon after ‘Abdullah was sent by his father to\nbuy dates in Madinah where he died. In another version, ‘Abdullah went to\nSyria on a trade journey and died in Madinah on his way back. He was buried\n\n-- 35 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n36\nin the house of An- Nabigha Al- Ju‘di. He was twenty- five years old when he\ndied. Most historians state that his death was two months before the birth of\nMuhammad [pbuh] . Some others said that his death was two months after\nthe Prophet’s birth. When Amina was informed of her husband’s death, she\ncelebrated his memory in a most heart- touching elegy. [Ibn Hisham 1/156-\n158; Fiqh As- Seerah p.45]\n‘Abdullah left very little wealth —five camels, a small number of goats, a she-\nservant, called Barakah – Umm Aiman – who would later serve as the Prophet’s\nnursemaid. [Muslim 2/96; Talqeeh Fahoom Ahl- Athar p.4; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-\nRasool p. 12]\n\n-- 36 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n37\nMuhammad’s Birth and Forty Years prior to Prophethood\nHis Birth\nMuhammad [pbuh], the Master of Prophets, was born in Bani Hashim lane in Makkah\non Monday morning, the ninth of Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, the same year of the Elephant\nEvent, and forty years of the reign of Kisra (Khosru Nushirwan), i.e. the twentieth or\ntwenty- second of April, 571 A.D., according to the scholar Muhammad Sulaim? \tAl-\nMansourpuri, and the astrologer Mahm? \tPasha. [Muhadarat Tareekh Al- Umam Al-\nIslamiyah 1/62; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/38,39]\nIbn Sa‘d reported that Muhammad’s mother said: \"When he was born, there was a\nlight that issued out of my pudendum and lit the palaces of Syria.\" Ahmad reported\non the authority of ‘Arbadh bin Sariya something similar to this. [Mukhtasar Seerat-\nur- Rasool, p.12; Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd 1/63]\nIt was but controversially reported that significant precursors accompanied his birth:\nfourteen galleries of Kisra’s palace cracked and rolled down, the Magians’ sacred fire\ndied down and some churches on Lake Sawa sank down and collapsed. [Reported by\nAl- Baihaqi, but Al- Ghazali didn't approve it - see Fiqh- us- Seerah p.46]\nHis mother immediately sent someone to inform his grandfather ‘Abdul- Muttalib of\nthe happy event. Happily he came to her, carried him to Al- Ka‘bah, prayed to All?\nand thanked Him. ‘Abdul- Muttalib called the baby Muhammad, a name not then\ncommon among the Arabs. He circumcised him on his seventh day as was the\ncustom of the Arabs. [Ibn Hisham 1/159,160; Zad Al- Ma'ad 1/18; Muhadarat\nTareekh Al- Umam Al- Islamiyah 1/62]\nThe first woman who suckled him after his mother was Thuyebah, the concubine of\nAbu Lahab, with her son, Masrouh. She had suckled Hamzah bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib\nbefore and later Abu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al- Asad Al- Makhzumi. [Talqeeh Furoom Ahl-\nal- Athar p.4; Mukhtasar Seerat- ur- Rasool p.13]\nBabyhood\nIt was the general custom of the Arabs living in towns to send their children away to\nbedouin wet nurses so that they might grow up in the free and healthy surroundings\nof the desert whereby they would develop a robust frame and acquire the pure\nspeech and manners of the bedouins, who were noted both for chastity of their\nlanguage and for being free from those vices which usually develop in sedentary\nsocieties.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was later entrusted to Haleemah bint Abi Dhuaib from Bani Sa‘d\nbin Bakr. Her husband was Al- Harith bin ‘Abdul ‘Uzza called Abi Kabshah, from the\nsame tribe.\nMuhammad [pbuh] had several foster brothers and sisters, ‘Abdullah bin Al- Harith,\nAneesah bint Al- Harith, Hudhafah or Judhamah bint Al- Harith (known as Ash-\nShayma’), and she used to nurse the Prophet [pbuh] and Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith\nbin ‘Abdul- Muttalib, the Prophet’s cousin. Hamzah bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib, the Prophet’s\n\n-- 37 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n38\nuncle, was suckled by the same two wet nurses, Thuyeba and Haleemah As-\nSa‘diyah, who suckled the Prophet [pbuh]. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 1/19]\nTraditions delightfully relate how Haleemah and the whole of her household were\nfavoured by successive strokes of good fortune while the baby Muhammad [pbuh]\nlived under her care. Ibn Ishaq states that Haleemah narrated that she along with\nher husband and a suckling babe, set out from her village in the company of some\nwomen of her clan in quest of children to suckle. She said:\nIt was a year of drought and famine and we had nothing to eat. I rode on a brown\nshe- ass. We also had with us an old she- camel. By All? \twe could not get even a\ndrop of milk. We could not have a wink of sleep during the night for the child kept\ncrying on account of hunger. There was not enough milk in my breast and even the\nshe- camel had nothing to feed him. We used to constantly pray for rain and\nimmediate relief. At length we reached Makkah looking for children to suckle. Not\neven a single woman amongst us accepted the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] offered to\nher. As soon as they were told that he was an orphan, they refused him. We had\nfixed our eyes on the reward that we would get from the child’s father. An orphan!\nWhat are his grandfather and mother likely to do? So we spurned him because of\nthat. Every woman who came with me got a suckling and when we were about to\ndepart, I said to my husband: \"By All? \t, I do not like to go back along with the other\nwomen without any baby. I should go to that orphan and I must take him.\" He said,\n\"There is no harm in doing so and perhaps All? \tmight bless us through him.\" So I\nwent and took him because there was simply no other alternative left for me but to\ntake him. When I lifted him in my arms and returned to my place I put him on my\nbreast and to my great surprise, I found enough milk in it. He drank to his heart’s\ncontent, and so did his foster brother and then both of them went to sleep although\nmy baby had not been able to sleep the previous night. My husband then went to the\nshe- camel to milk it and, to his astonishment, he found plenty of milk in it. He\nmilked it and we drank to our fill, and enjoyed a sound sleep during the night. The\nnext morning, my husband said: \"By All? \tHaleemah, you must understand that you\nhave been able to get a blessed child.\" And I replied: \"By the grace of All? \t, I hope\nso.\"\nThe tradition is explicit on the point that Haleemah’s return journey and her\nsubsequent life, as long as the Prophet [pbuh] stayed with her, was encircled with a\nhalo of good fortune. The donkey that she rode when she came to Makkah was lean\nand almost foundered; it recovered speed much to the amazement of Haleemah’s\nfellow travellers. By the time they reached the encampments in the country of the\nclan of Sa‘d, they found the scales of fortune turned in their favour. The barren land\nsprouted forth luxuriant grass and beasts came back to them satisfied and full of\nmilk. Muhammad [pbuh] stayed with Haleemah for two years until he was weaned as\nHaleemah said:\nWe then took him back to his mother requesting her earnestly to have him stay with\nus and benefit by the good fortune and blessings he had brought us. We persisted in\nour request which we substantiated by our anxiety over the child catching a certain\ninfection peculiar to Makkah.[Ibn Hisham 1/162- 164] At last, we were granted our\nwish and the Prophet [pbuh] stayed with us until he was four or five years of age.\nWhen, as related by Anas in \tSahih Muslim, Gabriel came down and ripped his chest\nopen and took out the heart. He then extracted a blood- clot out of it and said: \"That\n\n-- 38 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n39\nwas the part of Satan in thee.\" And then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a\ngold basin. After that the heart was joined together and restored to its place. The\nboys and playmates came running to his mother, i.e. his nurse, and said: \"Verily,\nMuhammad [pbuh] has been murdered.\" They all rushed towards him and found him\nall right only his face was white. [Muslim 1/92]\nBack to His Passionate Mother\nAfter this event, Haleemah was worried about the boy and returned him to his\nmother with whom he stayed until he was six. [Talqeeh Furoom Ahl- al- Athar p.7; Ibn\nHisham 1/168]\nIn respect of the memory of her late husband, Amina decided to visit his grave in\nYathrib (Madinah). She set out to cover a journey of 500 kilometers with her orphan\nboy, woman servant Umm Ayman and her father- in- law ‘Abdul- Muttalib. She spent a\nmonth there and then took her way back to Makkah. On the way, she had a severe\nillness and died in Abwa on the road between Makkah and Madinah. [Ibn Hisham\n1/168; Talqeeh Fuhroom Ahl- al- Athar p.7]\nTo His Compassionate Grandfather\n‘Abdul- Muttalib brought the boy to Makkah. He had warm passions towards the boy,\nhis orphan grandson, whose recent disaster (his mother’s death) added more to the\npains of the past. ‘Abdul- Muttalib was more passionate with his grandson than with\nhis own children. He never left the boy a prey to loneliness, but always preferred him\nto his own kids. Ibn Hisham reported: A mattress was put in the shade of Al- Ka‘bah\nfor ‘Abdul- Muttalib. His children used to sit around that mattress in honour to their\nfather, but Muhammad [pbuh] used to sit on it. His uncles would take him back, but\nif ‘Abdul- Muttalib was present, he would say: \"Leave my grandson. I swear by All?\nthat this boy will hold a significant position.\" He used to seat the boy on his\nmattress, pat his back and was always pleased with what the boy did. [Ibn Hisham\n1/168]\nWhen Muhammad [pbuh] was eight years, two months and ten days old, his\ngrandfather ‘Abdul- Muttalib passed away in Makkah. The charge of the Prophet\n[pbuh] was now passed on to his uncle Abu Talib, who was the brother of the\nProphet’s father.\nAbu Talib took the charge of his nephew in the best way. He put him with his\nchildren and preferred him to them. He singled the boy out with great respect and\nhigh esteem. Abu Talib remained for forty years cherishing his nephew and\nextending all possible protection and support to him. His relations with the others\nwere determined in the light of the treatment they showed to the Prophet [pbuh].\nIbn ‘Asakir reported on the authority of Jalhamah bin ‘Arfuta who said: \"I came to\nMakkah when it was a rainless year, so Quraish said ‘O Abu Talib, the valley has\nbecome leafless and the children hungry, let us go and pray for rain- fall.’ Abu Talib\nwent to Al- Ka‘bah with a young boy who was as beautiful as the sun, and a black\ncloud was over his head. Abu Talib and the boy stood by the wall of Al- Ka‘bah and\nprayed for rain. Immediately clouds from all directions gathered and rain fell heavily\n\n-- 39 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n40\nand caused the flow of springs and growth of plants in the town and the country.\n[Mukhtasar Seerat- ur- Rasool p.15,16]\nBahira, the Monk\nWhen the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] was twelve years old, he went with his uncle\nAbu Talib on a business journey to Syria. When they reached Busra (which was a\npart of Syria, in the vicinity of Howran under the Roman domain) they met a monk\ncalled Bahira (his real name was Georges), who showed great kindness, and\nentertained them lavishly. He had never been in the habit of receiving or\nentertaining them before. He readily enough recognized the Prophet [pbuh] and said\nwhile taking his hand: \"This is the master of all humans. All? \twill send him with a\nMessage which will be a mercy to all beings.\" Abu Talib asked: \"How do you know\nthat?\" He replied: \"When you appeared from the direction of ‘Aqabah, all stones and\ntrees prostrated themselves, which they never do except for a Prophet. I can\nrecognize him also by the seal of Prophethood which is below his shoulder, like an\napple. We have got to learn this from our books.\" He also asked Abu Talib to send\nthe boy back to Makkah and not to take him to Syria for fear of the Jews. Abu Talib\nobeyed and sent him back to Makkah with some of his men servants. [Ibn Hisham\n1/180- 183; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 1/17]\nThe ‘Sacrilegious’ Wars\nMuhammad [pbuh] was hardly fifteen when the ‘sacrilegious’ wars — which\ncontinued with varying fortunes and considerable loss of human life for a number of\nyears — broke out between Quraish and Banu Kinana on the one side and Qais ‘Ailan\ntribe on the other. It was thus called because the inviolables were made violable, the\nprohibited months being included. Harb bin Omaiyah, on account of his outstanding\nposition and honourable descent, used to be the leader of Quraish and their allies. In\none of those battles, the Prophet [pbuh] attended on his uncles but did not raise\narms against their opponents. His efforts were confined to picking up the arrows of\nthe enemy as they fell, and handing them over to his uncles. [Ibn Hisham 1/184-187;\nQalb Jazeerat Al-Arab p.260]\nAl-Fudoul Confederacy\nAt the conclusion of these wars, when peace was restored, people felt the need for\nforming confederacy at Makkah for suppressing violence and injustice, and\nvindicating the rights of the weak and the destitute. Representatives of Banu\nHashim, Banu Al- Muttalib, Asad bin ‘Abd Al- ‘Uzza, Zahrah bin Kilab and Taim bin\nMurra were called to meet in the habitation of an honourable elderly man called\n‘Abdullah bin Jada‘an At- Taimy to enter into a confederacy that would provide for the\nabove- mentioned items. The Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] shortly after he had been\nhonoured with the ministry of Prophethood, witnessed this league and commented\non it, with very positive words: \"I witnessed a confederacy in the house of ‘Abdullah\nbin Jada‘an. It was more appealing to me than herds of cattle. Even now in the\nperiod of Islam I would respond positively to attending such a meeting if I were\ninvited.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/113,135]\nIn fact, the spirit of this confederacy and the course of deliberations therein marked\na complete departure from the pre- Islamic tribal- pride. The story that led to its\n\n-- 40 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n41\nconvention says that a man from Zubaid clan came as a merchant to Makkah where\nhe sold some commodities to Al- ‘As bin Wail As- Sahmy. The latter by hook or by\ncrook tried to evade paying for the goods. The salesman sought help from the\ndifferent clans in Quraish but they paid no heed to his earnest pleas. He then\nresorted to a mountain top and began, at the top of his voice, to recite verses of\ncomplaint giving account of the injustices he sustained. Az- Zubair bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib\nheard of him and made inquiries into the matter. Consequently, the parties to the\naforesaid confederacy convened their meeting and managed to force Az- Zubaidy’s\nmoney out of Al- ‘As bin Wa’il. [Mukhtasar Seerat- ur- Rasool, p.30,31]\nMuhammad’s Early Job\nMuhammad [pbuh], had no particular job at his early youth, but it was reported that\nhe worked as a shepherd for Bani Sa‘d and in Makkah. At the age of 25, he went to\nSyria as a merchant for Khadijah [R]. Ibn Ishaq reported that Khadijah, daughter of\nKhwailid was a business- woman of great honour and fortune. She used to employ\nmen to do her business for a certain percentage of the profits. Quraish people were\nmostly tradespeople, so when Khadijah was informed of Muhammad [pbuh], his\ntruthful words, great honesty and kind manners, she sent for him. She offered him\nmoney to go to Syria and do her business, and she would give him a higher rate\nthan the others. She would also send her hireling, Maisarah, with him. He agreed\nand went with her servant to Syria for trade. [Ibn Hisham 1/187,188]\nHis Marriage to Khadijah\nWhen he returned to Makkah, Khadijah noticed, in her money, more profits and\nblessings than she used to. Her hireling also told her of Muhammad’s good manners,\nhonesty, deep thought, sincerity and faith. She realized that she homed at her\ntarget. Many prominent men had asked for her hand in marriage but she always\nspurned their advances. She disclosed her wish to her friend Nafisa, daughter of\nManiya, who immediately went to Muhammad [pbuh] and broke the good news to\nhim. He agreed and requested his uncles to go to Khadijah’s uncle and talk on this\nissue. Subsequently, they were married. The marriage contract was witnessed by\nBani Hashim and the heads of Mudar. This took place after the Prophet’s return from\nSyria. He gave her twenty camels as dowry. She was, then, forty years old and was\nconsidered as the best woman of her folk in lineage, fortune and wisdom. She was\nthe first woman whom the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] married. He did not get married\nto any other until she had died. [Ibn Hisham 1/189; Fiqh As- Seerah p.59; Talqeeh\nFahoom Ahl- al- Athar p.7]\nKhadijah bore all his children, except Ibrahim: Al- Qasim, Zainab, Ruqaiyah, Umm\nKulthum, Fatimah and ‘Abdullah who was called Taiyib and Tahir. All his sons died in\ntheir childhood and all the daughters except Fatimah died during his lifetime.\nFatimah died six months after his death. All his daughters witnessed Islam,\nembraced it, and emigrated to Madinah. [Ibn Hisham 1/190,191; Fath Al- Bari 7/507]\nRebuilding Al-Ka‘bah and the Arbitration Issue\nWhen the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] was thirty five, Quraish started rebuilding Al-\nKa‘bah. That was because it was a low building of white stones no more than 6.30\nmetres high, from the days of Ishmael. It was also roofless and that gave the thieves\n\n-- 41 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n42\neasy access to its treasures inside. It was also exposed to the wearing factors of\nnature — because it was built a long time ago — that weakened and cracked its\nwalls. Five years before Prophethood, there was a great flood in Makkah that swept\ntowards Al- Ka‘bah and almost demolished it. Quraish was obliged to rebuild it to\nsafeguard its holiness and position. The chiefs of Quraish decided to use only licit\nmoney in rebuilding Al- Ka‘bah, so all money that derived from harlotry, usury or\nunjust practices was excluded. They were, at first, too awed to knock down the wall,\nbut Al- Waleed bin Al- Mugheerah Al- Mukhzumi started the work. Seeing that no harm\nhad happened to him, the others participated in demolishing the walls until they\nreached the basis laid by Abraham. When they started rebuilding its walls, they\ndivided the work among the tribes. Each tribe was responsible for rebuilding a part of\nit. The tribes collected stones and started work. The man who laid the stones was a\nRoman mason called Baqum. The work went on in harmony till the time came to put\nthe sacred Black Stone in its proper place. Then strife broke out among the chiefs,\nand lasted for four or five days, each contesting for the honour of placing the stone\nin its position. Daggers were on the point of being drawn and great bloodshed\nseemed imminent. Luckily, the oldest among the chiefs Abu Omaiyah bin Mugheerah\nAl- Makhzumi made a proposal which was accepted by all. He said: \"Let him, who\nenters the Sanctuary first of all, decide on the point.\" It was then All? \t’s Will that the\nMessenger of All? \t[pbuh] should be the first to enter the Mosque. On seeing him, all\nthe people on the scene, cried with one voice: \"Al- Ameen \t(the trustworthy) has\ncome. We are content to abide by his decision.\" Calm and self- possessed,\nMuhammad [pbuh] received the commission and at once resolved upon an expedient\nwhich was to conciliate them all. He asked for a mantle which he spread on the\nground and placed the stone in its centre. He then asked the representatives of the\ndifferent clans among them, to lift the stone all together. When it had reached the\nproper place, Muhammad [pbuh] laid it in the proper position with his own hands.\nThis is how a very tense situation was eased and a grave danger averted by the\nwisdom of the Prophet [pbuh].\nQuraish ran short of the licit money, they collected, so they eliminated six yards area\non the northern side of Al- Ka‘bah which is called Al- Hijr or Al- Hateem. They raised its\ndoor two metres from the level ground to let in only the people whom they desired.\nWhen the structure was fifteen yards high they erected the roof which rested on six\ncolumns.\nWhen the building of Al- Ka‘bah had finished, it assumed a square form fifteen metres\nhigh. The side with the Black Stone and the one opposite were ten metres long each.\nThe Black Stone was 1.50 metre from the circumambulation level ground. The two\nother sides were twelve metres long each. The door was two metres high from the\nlevel ground. A building structure of 0.25 metre high and 0.30 metre wide on the\naverage surrounded Al- Ka‘bah. It was called Ash- Shadherwan, originally an integral\npart of the Sacred Sanctuary, but Quraish left it out. [Bukhari 1/215; Fiqh As- Seerah\np.62- 63; Ibn Hisham 2/192- 197]\nA Rapid Review of Muhammad’s Biography before Commissioning of the\nProphethood\nProphet Muhammad [pbuh] was, in his youth, a combination of the best social\nattributes. He was an exemplary man of weighty mind and faultless insight. He was\nfavoured with intelligence, originality of thought and accurate choice of the means\nleading to accurate goals. His long silence helped favourably in his habit of\n\n-- 42 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n43\nmeditation and deep investigation into the truth. His vivid mind and pure nature\nwere helpfully instrumental in assimilating and comprehending ways of life and\npeople, individual and community- wise. He shunned superstitious practices but took\nan active part in constructive and useful dealings, otherwise, he would have recourse\nto his self- consecrated solitude. He kept himself aloof from drinking wine, eating\nmeat slaughtered on stone altars, or attending idolatrous festivals. He held the idols\nin extreme aversion and most abhorrence. He could never tolerate someone\nswearing by Al- Lat and Al- ‘Uzza. All? \t’s providence, no doubts, detached him from all\nabominable or evil practices. Even when he tried to obey his instinct to enjoy some\nlife pleasures or follow some irrespectable traditions, All? \t’s providence intervened to\ncurb any lapse in this course. Ibn Al- Atheer reported Muhammad [pbuh] as saying:\n\"I have never tried to do what my people do except for two times. Every time All?\nintervened and checked me from doing so and I never did that again. Once I told my\nfellow- shepherd to take care of my sheep when we were in the upper part of\nMakkah. I wanted to go down to Makkah and entertain myself as the young men did.\nI went down to the first house of Makkah where I heard music. I entered and asked:\n‘What is this?’ Someone answered: ‘It is a wedding party.’ I sat down and listened\nbut soon went into deep sleep. I was awakened by the heat of the sun. I went back\nto my fellow- shepherd and told him of what had happened to me. I have never tried\nit again.\"\nAl- Bukhari reported on the authority of Jabir bin ‘Abdullah that he said: \"While the\npeople were rebuilding Al- Ka‘bah, the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] went with ‘Abbas\nto carry some stones. ‘Abbas said: ‘Put your loincloth round your neck to protect you\nfrom the stones.’ (As he did that) the Prophet [pbuh] fell to the ground and his eyes\nturned skyward. Later on he woke up and shouted: ‘My loincloth... my loincloth.’ He\nwrapped himself in his loincloth.\" In another report: \"His loins were never seen\nafterwards.\" [Bukhari Chapter: The Building of Al- Ka'bah, 1/540]\nThe authorities agree in ascribing to the youth of Muhammad [pbuh] modesty of\ndeportment, virtuous behaviour and graceful manners. He proved himself to be the\nideal of manhood, and to possess a spotless character. He was the most obliging to\nhis compatriots, the most honest in his talk and the mildest in temper. He was the\nmost gentle- hearted, chaste, hospitable and always impressed people by his piety-\ninspiring countenance. He was the most truthful and the best to keep covenant. His\nfellow- citizens, by common consent, gave him the title of \tAl- ‘Ameen \t(trustworthy).\nThe Mother of believers, Khadijah [R], once said: He unites uterine relations, he\nhelps the poor and the needy, he entertains the guests and endures hardships in the\npath of truthfulness. [Bukhari 1/3]\n\n-- 43 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n44\nIn the Shade of the Message and Prophethood\nWhen Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] was nearly forty, he had been wont to pass long\nhours in retirement meditating and speculating over all aspects of creation around\nhim. This meditative temperament helped to widen the mental gap between him and\nhis compatriots. He used to provide himself with \tSawiq \t(barley porridge) and water\nand then directly head for the hills and ravines in the neighbourhood of Makkah. One\nof these in particular was his favourite resort — a cave named Hira’, in the Mount\nAn- Nour. It was only two miles from Makkah, a small cave 4 yards long and 1.75\nyard wide. He would always go there and invite wayfarers to share him his modest\nprovision. He used to devote most of his time, and Ramadan in particular, to worship\nand meditation on the universe around him. His heart was restless about the moral\nevils and idolatry that were rampant among his people; he was as yet helpless\nbecause no definite course, or specific approach had been available for him to follow\nand rectify the ill practices around him. This solitude attended with this sort of\ncontemplative approach must be understood in its Divine perspective. It was a\npreliminary stage to the period of grave responsibilities that he was to shoulder very\nsoon. [Rahmat Al- lil'alameen 1/47; Ibn Hisham 1/235,236; Fi Zilal Al- Qur'an 29/166]\nPrivacy and detachment from the impurities of life were two indispensable\nprerequisites for the Prophet’s soul to come into close communion with the Unseen\nPower that lies behind all aspects of existence in this infinite universe. It was a rich\nperiod of privacy which lasted for three years and ushered in a new era, of\nindissoluble contact with that Power. [Fi Zilal Al- Qur'an 29/166,167]\nInterruption of Revelation\nIbn Sa‘d reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas that the Revelation paused for a few\ndays.[Fath Al- Bari 1/27,12/360] After careful study, this seems to be the most\npossible. To say that it lasted for three and a half years, as some scholars allege, is\nnot correct, but here there is no room to go into more details.\nMeanwhile, the Prophet [pbuh], was caught in a sort of depression coupled with\nastonishment and perplexity. Al- Bukhari reported:\nThe Divine inspiration paused for a while and the Prophet [pbuh] became so sad, as\nwe have heard, that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high\nmountains, and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw\nhimself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say: \"O Muhammad! You are\nindeed All? \t’s Messenger in truth,\" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he\nwould calm down and return home. Whenever the period of the coming of the\nRevelation used to become long, he would do as before, but Gabriel would appear\nagain before him and say to him what he had said before. [Bukhari 2/340]\nOnce more, Gabriel brings All? \t’s Revelation\nIbn Hajar said: ‘That (the pause of All? \t’s revelation for a few days) was to relieve\nthe Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] of the fear he experienced and to make him long for\nthe Revelation. When the shades of puzzle receded, the flags of truth were raised,\nthe Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] knew for sure that he had become the Messenger of\nthe Great Lord. He was also certain that what had come to him was no more than\n\n-- 44 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n45\nthe ambassador of inspiration. His waiting and longing for the coming of the\nrevelation constituted a good reason for his steadfastness and self- possession on the\narrival of All? \t’s inspiration, Al- Bukhari reported on the authority of Jabir bin\n‘Abdullah that he had heard the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] speak about the period of\npause as follows:\n\"While I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up, and surely enough,\nit was the same angel who had visited me in the cave of Hira’. He was sitting on a\nchair between the earth and the sky. I was very afraid of him and knelt on the\nground. I went home saying: ‘Cover me …, Cover me …’. All? \trevealed to me the\nverses:\n‘O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And\nyour Lord (All? \t) magnify! And your garments purify! And keep away from\nAr- Rujz \t(the idols)!’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 74:1- 5]\nAfter that the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly. [Bukhari,\nThe Book of Tafseer, 2/733]\nSome details pertinent to the successive stages of Revelation\nBefore we go into the details of the period of communicating the Message and\nProphethood, we would like to get acquainted with the stages of the Revelation\nwhich constituted the main source of the Message and the subject- matter of the Call.\nIbn Al- Qayyim, mentioning the stages of the Revelation, said:\nThe First: \tThe period of true vision. It was the starting point of the Revelation to the\nMessenger of All? \t[pbuh].\nThe Second: \tWhat the angel invisibly cast in the Prophet’s mind and heart. The\nMessenger of All? \t[pbuh] said: \"The Noble Spirit revealed to me ‘No soul will perish\nuntil it exhausts its due course, so fear All? \tand gently request Him. Never get so\nimpatient to the verge of disobedience of All? \t. What All? \thas can never be acquired\nbut through obedience to Him.’\"\nThe Third: \tThe angel used to visit the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] in the form of a\nhuman being and would speak to him directly. This would enable him to fully\nunderstand what the angel said. The angel was sometimes seen in this form by the\nProphet’s Companions.\nThe Fourth: \tThe angel came to him like the toll of a bell and this was the most\ndifficult form because the angel used to seize him tightly and sweat would stream\nfrom his forehead even on the coldest day. If the Prophet [pbuh] was on his camel,\nthe camel would not withstand the weight, so it would immediately kneel down on\nthe ground. Once the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] had such a revelation when he was\nsitting and his thigh was on Zaid’s, Zaid felt the pressure had almost injured his\nthigh.\n\n-- 45 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n46\nThe Fifth: \tThe Prophet [pbuh] saw the angel in his actual form. The angel would\nreveal to him what All? \thad ordered him to reveal. This, as mentioned in (Qur’? \t), in\nS? \tah An- Najm \t(Chapter 53 - The Star), happened twice.\nThe Sixth:",
  " \tWhat All? \tHimself revealed to him in heaven i.e. when he ascended to\nheaven and received All? \t’s behest of \tSal? \t(prayer).\nThe Seventh: \tAll? \t’s Words to His Messenger [pbuh] at first hand without the\nmediation of an angel. It was a privilege granted to Moses \t? \t? \t??? \tand clearly\nattested in the Qur’? \t, as it is attested to our Prophet [pbuh] in the \tS? \tah Al-\nIsr?#146; \t(Chapter 17 - The Journey by Night) of the Noble Qur’? \t.\nSome religious scholars added a controversial eighth stage in which they state that\nAll? \tspoke to the Prophet [pbuh] directly without a curtain in between. This issue\nremains however unconfirmed. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 1/18]\nProclaiming All? \t, the All-High; and the Immediate Constituents\nThe first Revelation sent to the Prophet [pbuh] implied several injunctions, simple in\nform but highly effective and of serious far- reaching ramifications. The angel\ncommunicated to him a manifest Message saying:\n\"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And\nyour Lord (All? \t) magnify! And your garments purify! And keep away from\nAr- Rujz \t(the idols). And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider\nnot your deeds of All? \t’s obedience as a favour to All? \t). And be patient for\nthe sake of your Lord (i.e. perform your duty to All? \t)!\" \t[Al- Qur'an 74:1- 7]\nFor convenience and ease of understanding, we are going to segment the Message\ninto its immediate constituents:\n1. \tThe ultimate objective of warning is to make sure that no one breaching the\npleasures of All? \tin the whole universe is ignorant of the serious\nconsequences that his behaviour entails, and to create a sort of\nunprecedented shock within his mind and heart.\n2. \t‘Magnifying the Lord’ dictates explicitly that the only pride allowed to nourish\non the earth is exclusively All? \t’s to the exclusion of all the others’.\n3. \t‘Cleansing the garments and shunning all aspects of abomination’ point\ndirectly to the indispensable need to render both the exterior and interior\nexceptionally chaste and pure, in addition to the prerequisite of sanctifying\nthe soul and establishing it highly immune against the different sorts of\nimpurities and the various kinds of pollutants. Only through this avenue can\nthe soul of the Prophet [pbuh] reach an ideal status and become eligible to\nenjoy the shady mercy of All? \tand His protection, security, guidance and\never- shining light; and will consequently set the highest example to the\nhuman community, attract the sound hearts and inspire awe and reverence in\nthe stray ones in such a manner that all the world, in agreement or\ndisagreement, will head for it and take it as the rock- bed in all facets of their\nwelfare.\n\n-- 46 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n47\n4. \tThe Prophet [pbuh] must not regard his strife in the way of All? \tas a deed of\ngrace that entitles him to a great reward. On the contrary, he has to exert\nhimself to the utmost, dedicate his whole efforts and be ready to offer all\nsacrifices in a spirit of self- forgetfulness enveloped by an ever- present\nawareness of All? \t, without the least sense of pride in his deeds or sacrifices.\n5. \tThe last verse of the Qur’? \trevealed to the Prophet [pbuh] alludes to the\nhostile attitude of the obdurate disbelievers, who will jeer at him and his\nfollowers. They are expected to disparage him and step up their malice to the\npoint of scheming against his life and lives of all the believers around him. In\nthis case he has got to be patient and is supposed to persevere and display\nthe highest degree of stamina for the sole purpose of attaining the pleasure of\nAll? \t.\nThese were the basic preliminaries that the Prophet [pbuh] had to observe, very\nsimple injunctions in appearance, greatly fascinating in their calm rhythm, but highly\neffective in practice. They constituted the trigger that aroused a far- ranging tempest\nin all the corners of the world.\nThe verses comprise the constituents of the new call and propagation of the new\nfaith. A warning logically implies that there are malpractices with painful\nconsequences to be sustained by the perpetrators, and since the present life is not\nnecessarily the only room to bring people to account for their misdeeds or some of\nthem, then the warning would necessarily imply calling people to account on another\nday, i.e. the Day of Resurrection, and this per se suggests the existence of a life\nother than this one we are living. All the verses of the Noble Qur’? \tcall people to\ntestify explicitly to the Oneness of All? \t, to delegate all their affairs to All? \t, the All-\nHigh, and to subordinate the desires of the self and the desires of All? \t’s servants to\nthe attainment of His Pleasures.\nThe constituents of the call to Islam could, briefly speaking, go as follows:\nA. \tTestimony to the Oneness of All? \t.\nB. \tBelief in the Hereafter.\nC. \tSanctifying one’s soul and elevating it high above evils and abominations that\nconduce to terrible consequences, besides this, there is the dire need for\nvirtues and perfect manners coupled with habituating oneself to righteous\ndeeds.\nD. \tCommitting one’s all affairs to All? \t, the All- High.\nE. \tAll the foregoing should run as a natural corollary to unwavering belief in\nMuhammad’s Message, and abidance by his noble leadership and righteous\nguidance.\nThe verses have been prefaced, in the voice of the Most High, by a heavenly call\nmandating the Prophet [pbuh] to undertake this daunting responsibility (calling\npeople unto All? \t). The verses meant to extract him forcibly out of his sleep, divest\nhim of his mantle and detach him from the warmth and quiet of life, and then drive\nhim down a new course attended with countless hardships, and requiring a great\ndeal of strife in the way of All? \t:\n\n-- 47 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n48\n\"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 74:1- 2]\nSuggesting that to live to oneself is quite easy, but it has been decided that you\nhave to shoulder this heavy burden; consequently sleep, comfort, or warm bed are\nitems decreed to be alien in your lexicon of life. O Muhammad, arise quickly for the\nstrife and toil awaiting you; no time is there for sleep and such amenities; grave\nresponsibilities have been Divinely determined to fall to your lot, and drive you into\nthe turmoil of life to develop a new sort of precarious affinity with the conscience of\npeople and the reality of life.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] managed quite successfully to rise to his feet and measure up to\nthe new task, he went ahead in a spirit of complete selflessness, relentlessly striving\nand never abating in carrying the burden of the great Trust, the burden of\nenlightening mankind, and the heavy weight of the new faith and strife for over\ntwenty years, nothing distracting his attention from the awesome commission. May\nAll? \treward him, for us and all humanity, the best ending. The following research at\nhand gives an account in miniature of his long strive and uninterrupted struggle he\nmade after receiving the ministry of Messengership. [Fi Zilal Al- Qur'an 29/168-\n171,182]\n\n-- 48 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n49\nPhases and Stages of the Call\nThe Muhammadan Call could be divided into two phases distinctively demarcated:\n1. \tThe Makkan phase: nearly thirteen years.\n2. \tThe Madinese phase: fully ten years.\nEach of the two phases included distinctive features easily discernible through\naccurate scrutiny into the circumstances that characterized each of them.\nThe Makkan phase can be divided into three stages:\n1. \tThe stage of the secret Call: three years.\n2. \tThe stage of the proclamation of the Call in Makkah: from the beginning of\nthe fourth year of Prophethood to almost the end of the tenth year.\n3. \tThe stage of the call to Islam and propagating it beyond Makkah: it lasted\nfrom the end of tenth year of the Prophethood until Muhammad’s [pbuh]\nemigration to Madinah.\nThe Madinese phase will be considered later in its due course.\nThe First Stage : Strife in the Way of the Call\nThree Years of Secret Call\nIt is well- known that Makkah was the centre for the Arabs, and housed the\ncustodians of Al- Ka‘bah. Protection and guardianship of the idols and stone graven\nimages that received veneration on the part of all the Arabs lay in the hands of the\nMakkans. Hence the difficulty of hitting the target of reform and rectitude in a place\nconsidered the den of idolatry. Working in such an atmosphere no doubt requires\nunshakable will and determination, that is why the call unto Islam assumed a\nclandestine form so that the Makkans should not be enraged by the unexpected\nsurprise.\nThe Early Converts\nThe Prophet [pbuh] naturally initiated his sacred mission right from home and then\nmoved to the people closely associated with him. He called unto Islam whomsoever\nhe thought would attest the truth which had come from his Lord. In fact, a host of\npeople who nursed not the least seed of doubt as regards the Prophet [pbuh],\nimmediately responded and quite readily embraced the true faith. They are known in\nthe Islamic literature as the early converts.\nKhadijah, the Prophet’s spouse, the mother of believers, was the first to enter the\nfold of Islam followed by his freed slave Zaid bin Harithah, his cousin, ‘Ali bin Abi\nTalib, who had been living with him since his early childhood, and next came his\nintimate friend Abu Bakr As- Siddiq (Abu Bakr the truth verifier). All of those\nprofessed Islam on the very first day of the call. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/50] Abu\nBakr, and from the first day he embraced Islam, proved to be an energetic and most\n\n-- 49 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n50\nzealous activist. He was wealthy, obliging, mild and upright. People used to frequent\nhis house and draw nigh to him for his knowledge, amity, pleasant company and\nbusiness. He invited whomever he had confidence in to Islam and through his\npersonal efforts a good number of people converted to Islam, such as ‘Uthman bin\n‘Affan Al- Umawi, Az- Zubair bin ‘Awwam Al- Asadi, ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, Sa‘d bin\nAbi Waqqas, Az- Zuhri and Talhah bin ‘Ubaidullah At- Tamimy. Those eight men\nconstituted the forerunners and more specifically the vanguard of the new faith in\nArabia. Among the early Muslim were Bilal bin Rabah (the Abyssinian), Abu ‘Ubaidah\nbin Al- Jarrah from Bani Harith bin Fahr (the most trustworthy of the Muslim Nation),\nAbu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al- Asad, Al- Arqam bin Abi Al- Arqam from the tribe of\nMakhzum, ‘Uthman bin Maz‘oun and his two brothers Qudama and ‘Abdullah,\n‘Ubaidah bin Al- Harith bin Al- Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf, Sa‘id bin Zaid Al- ‘Adawi and\nhis wife Fatimah - daughter of Al- Khattab (the sister of ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab),\nKhabbab bin Al- Aratt, ‘Abdull? \tbin Mas‘ud Al- Hadhali and many others. These were\nthe Muslim predecessors. They belonged to various septs of Quraish. Ibn Hisham, a\nbiographer, counted them to be more than forty. [Ibn Hisham 1/245- 262]\nIbn Ishaq said: \"Then people entered the fold of Islam in hosts, men or women and\nthe new faith could no longer be kept secret.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/262]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] used to meet and teach, the new converts, the religion in privacy\nbecause the call to Islam was still running on an individual and secret basis.\nRevelation accelerated and continued after the first verses of \"O you wrapped in\ngarments.\" The verses and pieces of \tS? \tah \t(chapters) revealed at this time were\nshort ones with wonderful strong pauses and quite fascinating rhythms in full\nharmony with that delicate whispering setting. The central topic running through\nthem focused on sanctifying the soul, and deterring the Muslims from falling prey to\nthe deceptive glamour of life. The early verses used as well to give a highly accurate\naccount of the Hell and the Garden (Paradise), leading the believers down a new\ncourse diametrically opposed to the ill practices rampant amongst their compatriots.\nAs-Sal? \t(the Prayer)\nMuqatil bin Sulaiman said: \"Sal? \t(prayer) was established as an obligatory ritual at\nan early stage of the Islamic Call, a two \trak‘ ah \t(unit of prayer) \tSal? \tin the morning\nand the same in the evening:\n\"And glorify the praises of your Lord in the \t‘Ashi \t(i.e. the time period after\nthe mid- noon till sunset) and in the \tIbkar \t(i.e. the time period from early\nmorning or sunrise till before mid- noon).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 40:55]\nIbn Hijr said: \"Definitely the Prophet [pbuh] used to pray before ‘The Night Journey’\nbut it still remains a matter of controversy whether or not the prayer was established\nas an obligatory ritual before imposing the rules of the usual five prayers a day. It is\nrelated that obligatory prayer was established twice a day, in the morning before\nsunrise and after sunset. It is reported through a chain of narrators that when the\nProphet [pbuh] received the first Revelation, Gabriel - the angel, proceeded and\ntaught him how to observe \tWudu \t(ablution). When the Prophet [pbuh] had finished,\nhe took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his loins. [Mukhtasar Seerat- ur- Rasool\np.88]\n\n-- 50 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n51\nIbn Hisham reported that when it was time for prayers, the Messenger of All?\n[pbuh] and his Companions went into a mountain valley to pray secretly. Abu Talib\nonce saw the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] and Ali praying, he asked them what they\nwere up to. When he got to know that it was obligatory prayer, he told them to stay\nconstant in their practice. [Ibn Hisham 1/247]\nThe Quraishites learn about the Call\nThis stage of the Call, even though conducted in a clandestine manner and on an\nindividual basis, its news leaked out and assumed a public interest all over Makkah.\nIn the beginning, the Makkan leaders did not care much about Muhammad\n[pbuh]and took no heed of his teachings. At first, they thought that Muhammad\n[pbuh] was merely a religious philosophist like Omaiyah bin Abi As- Salt, Quss bin\nSa‘idah, ‘Amr bin Nufail and their ilk who used to philosophize on godship and\nreligious obligations. But this attitude of indifference soon changed into real\napprehension. The polytheists of Quraish began to watch Muhammad’s movements\nclosely and anxiously for fear of spreading his Call and producing a change in the\nprevalent mentality. [Fiqh As- Seerah p.76]\nFor three underground years of activism, a group of believers emerged stamped by a\nspirit of fraternity and cooperation with one definite objective in their mind:\npropagating and deeply establishing the call unto Islam. For full three years\nMuhammad [pbuh] had been content to teach within a rather narrow circle. The time\nhad, however, come to preach the faith of the Lord openly. The angel Gabriel had\nbrought him down a further Revelation of All? \t’s Will to confront his people,\ninvalidate their falsehood and crush down their idolatrous practices.\n\n-- 51 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n52\nThe Second Phase: Open Preaching\nFirst Revelation regarding the Preaching\n\"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred.\" [Al- Qur'an 26:214].\nThis was the first verse to be revealed in this concern. It is included in \tS? \tah \tAsh-\nShu‘ar?/i> (Chapter 26 – The Poets) which relates the story of Moses [AWS] from his\nearly days of Prophethood going through his migration with the Children of Israel,\ntheir escape from the Pharaoh and his folk, and the drowning Pharaoh and his hosts.\nThis Chapter in fact narrates the different stages that Moses [AWS] passed through\nin his struggle with Pharaoh and the mission of calling his people unto All? \t.\nMoreover, it includes stories that speak about the terrible end in store for those who\nbelied the Messengers such as the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Lout and\nAhlul- Aikah (Companions of the Wood). (A group of people who used to worship a\ntree called Aikah)\nChronologically, this Chapter belongs to the middle Makkan period, when the contact\nof the light of Prophecy with the cultural milieu of pagan Makkah was testing the\nMakkans in their most arrogant mood. The Message that this Chapter communicates\nis in brief: \"The Truth is insurmountable. When the spirit of Prophecy came to\nMakkah, it was resisted by the votaries of evil; but Truth, unlike falsehood, is bound\nto stay, whereas falsehood is surely perishable.\"\nCalling the Closest Kinspeople\nIn obedience to All? \t’s Commands, Muhammad [pbuh] rallied his kinsmen of Bani\nHashim with a group of Bani Al- Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf. The audience counted forty-\nfive men.\nAbu Lahab immediately took the initiative and addressed the Prophet [pbuh]: \"These\nare your uncles and cousins, speak on to the point, but first of all you have got to\nknow that your kinspeople are not in a position to withstand all the Arabs. Another\npoint you have got to bear in mind is that your relatives are sufficient unto you. If\nyou follow their tradition, it will be easier for them than to face the other clans of\nQuraish supported by the other Arabs. Verily, I have never heard of anyone who has\nincurred more harm on his kinspeople than you.\" The Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] kept\nsilent and said nothing in that meeting.\nHe invited them to another meeting and managed to secure audience. He then stood\nup and delivered a short speech explaining quite cogently what was at stake. He\nsaid: \"I celebrate All? \t’s praise, I seek His help, I believe in Him, I put my trust in\nHim, I bear witness that there is no god to be worshipped but All? \twith no associate.\nA guide can never lie to his people. I swear by All? \t, there is no god but He, that I\nhave been sent as a Messenger to you, in particular and to all the people, in general.\nI swear by All? \tyou will die just as you sleep, you will be resurrected just as you\nwake up. You will be called to account for your deeds. It is then either Hell forever or\nthe Garden (Paradise) forever.\"\n\n-- 52 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n53\nAbu Talib replied: \"We love to help you, accept your advice and believe in your\nwords. These are your kinspeople whom you have collected and I am one of them\nbut I am the fastest to do what you like. Do what you have been ordered. I shall\nprotect and defend you, but I can’t quit the religion of ‘Abdul- Muttalib.\"\nAbu Lahab then said to Abu Talib: \" I swear by All? \tthat this is a bad thing. You\nmust stop him before the others do.\" Abu Talib, however, answered: \"I swear by\nAll? \tto protect him as long as I am alive.\" [Fiqh As- Seerah p.77,78]\nOn Mount As-Safa\nAfter the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] became sure of Abu Talib’s commitment to his\nprotection while he called the people unto All? \t, he stood up on Mount As- Safa one\nday and called out loudly: \"O \tSabahah! \t[This is an Arabic expression used when one\nappeals for help or draws the attention of others to some dangers] \" Septs of\nQuraish came to him. He called them to testify to the Oneness of All? \tand believe in\nhis Messengership and the Day of Resurrection. Al- Bukhari reported part of this story\non the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas [R]. He said: \"When the following verses were\nrevealed:\n\"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred.\" [Al- Qur'an 26:214]\nThe Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] ascended Mount As- Safa and started to call: \"O Bani\nFahr! O Bani ‘Adi (two septs of Quraish).\" Many people gathered and those who\ncouldn’t, sent somebody to report to them. Abu Lahab was also present. The Prophet\n[pbuh] said: \"You see, if I were to tell you that there were some horsemen in the\nvalley planning to raid you, will you believe me?\" They said: \"Yes, we have never\nexperienced any lie from you.\" He said: \"I am a warner to you before a severe\ntorment.\" Abu Lahab promptly replied: \"Perish you all the day! Have you summoned\nus for such a thing?\" The verses were immediately revealed on that occasion\n[Bukhari 2/702; Muslim 1/114]:\n\"Perish the two hands of Abi Lahab...\" [Al- Qur'an 111:1].\nMuslim reported another part of this story on the authority of Abu Hurairah [R] — He\nsaid: \"When the following verses were revealed:\n\"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred.\" [26:214]\nThe Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] called all the people of Quraish; so they gathered and\nhe gave them a general warning. Then he made a particular reference to certain\ntribes, and said: \"O Quraish, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O people of Bani Ka‘b,\nrescue yourselves from Fire; O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad [pbuh] , rescue\nyourself from the Fire, for I have no power to protect you from All? \tin anything\nexcept that I would sustain relationship with you.\" [Muslim 1/114; Bukhari\n1/385,2/702]\nIt was verily a loud suggestive Call stating unequivocally to the closest people that\nbelief in his Message constituted the corner- stone of any future relation between him\nand them, and that the blood- relation on which the whole Arabian life was based,\nhad ceased to exist in the light of that Divine ultimatum.\n\n-- 53 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n54\nShouting the Truth and the Polytheists’ Reaction\nThe Prophet’s voice kept reverberating in Makkah until the following verse was\nrevealed:\n\"Therefore proclaim openly (All? \t’s Message — Islamic Monotheism), that which you\nare commanded, and turn away from \tAl- Mushrik? \t(polytheists).\" [Al- Qur'an 15:94]\nHe then commenced discrediting the superstitious practices of idolatry, revealing its\nworthless reality and utter impotence, and giving concrete proofs that idolatry per se\nor taking it as the media through which an idolater could come in contact with All? \t,\nis manifest falsehood.\nThe Makkans, on their part, burst into outrage and disapproval. Muhammad’s [pbuh]\nwords created a thunderbolt that turned the Makkan time- honoured ideological life\nupside down. They could ill afford to hear someone attaching to polytheists and\nidolaters, the description of straying people. They started to rally their resources to\nsettle down the affair, quell the onward marching revolution and deal a pre- emptive\nstrike to its votaries before it devours and crushes down their consecrated traditions\nand long standing heritage. The Makkans had the deep conviction that denying\ngodship to anyone save All? \tand that belief in the Divine Message and the Hereafter\nare interpreted in terms of complete compliance and absolute commitment, and this\nin turn leaves no area at all for them to claim authority over themselves and over\ntheir wealth, let alone their subordinates. In short, their arrogated religiously- based\nsupremacy and highhandedness would no longer be in effect; their pleasures would\nbe subordinated to the pleasures of All? \tand His Messenger and lastly they would\nhave to abstain from incurring injustices on those whom they falsely deemed to be\nweak, and perpetrating dreadful sins in their everyday life. They had already been\nfully aware of these meanings, that is why their souls would not condescend to\naccept this ‘disgraceful’ position not out of motives based on dignity and honour but\nrather because:\n\"Nay! (Man denies Resurrection and Reckoning. So) he desires to continue\ncommitting sins.\" [Al- Qur'an 75:5]\nThey had been aware of all these consequences but they could afford to do nothing\nbefore an honest truthful man who was the highest example of good manners and\nhuman values. They had never known such an example in the history of their folks or\ngrandfathers. What would they do? They were baffled, and they had the right to be\nso.\nFollowing careful deliberations, they hit upon the only target available, i.e. to contact\nthe Messenger’s uncle, Abu Talib and request him to intervene and advise his\nnephew to stop his activities. In order to attach a serious and earnest stamp to their\ndemand, they chose to touch the most sensitive area in Arabian life, viz., ancestral\npride. They addressed Abu Talib in the following manner: \"O Abu Talib! Your nephew\ncurses our gods; finds faults with our way of life, mocks at our religion and degrades\nour forefathers; either you must stop him, or you must let us get at him. For you are\nin the same opposition as we are in opposition to him; and we will rid you of him.\"\nAbu Talib tried to appease their wrath by giving them a polite reply. The Prophet\n[pbuh] , however, continued on his way preaching All? \t’s religion and calling men\n\n-- 54 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n55\nhitherto, heedless of all their desperate attempts and malicious intentions. [Ibn\nHisham 1/265]\nAn Advisory Council to debar Pilgrims from Muhammad’s Call\nDuring those days, Quraish had another serious concern; the proclamation of the\nCall had only been a few months old when the season of pilgrimage was soon to\ncome. Quraish knew that the Arab delegates were coming within a short time. They\nagreed that it was necessary to contemplate a device that was bound to alienate the\nArab pilgrims from the new faith preached by Muhammad [pbuh] . They went to see\nAl- Waleed bin Al- Mugheerah to deliberate on this issue. Al- Waleed invited them to\nagree on a unanimous resolution that could enjoy the approbation of them all.\nHowever, they were at variance. Some suggested that they describe him as \tKahin,\ni.e., soothsayer; but this suggestion was turned down on grounds that his words\nwere not so rhymed. Others proposed \tMajnun, i.e., possessed by jinn; this was also\nrejected because no insinuations peculiar to that state of mind ware detected, they\nclaimed. \"Why not say he is a poet?\" Some said. Here again they could not reach a\ncommon consent, alleging that his words were totally outside the lexicon of poetry.\n\"OK then; let us accuse him of practising witchcraft,\" was a fourth suggestion. Here\nalso Al- Waleed showed some reluctance saying that the Prophet [pbuh] was known\nto have never involved himself in the practice of blowing on the knots, and admitted\nthat his speech was sweet tasting root and branch. He, however, found that the most\nplausible charge to be levelled against Muhammad [pbuh] was witchcraft. The\nungodly company adopted this opinion and agreed to propagate one uniform formula\nto the effect that he was a magician so powerful and commanding in his art that he\nwould successfully alienate son from father, man from his brother, wife from her\nhusband and man from his clan. [Ibn Hisham 1/271; Fi Zilal Al- Qur'an 29/188]\nIt is noteworthy in this regard to say that All? \trevealed sixteen verses as regards Al-\nWaleed and the cunning method he contemplated to manipulate the people expected\nto arrive in Makkah for pilgrimage. All? \tsays:\n\"Verily, he thought and plotted; so let him be cursed! How he plotted! And once\nmore let him be cursed, how he plotted! Then he thought; then he frowned and he\nlooked in a bad tempered way; then he turned back and was proud; then he said:\n‘This is nothing but magic from that of old; this is nothing but the word of a human\nbeing!’ \" [Al- Qur'an 74:18- 25]\nThe most wicked of them was the sworn enemy of Islam and Muhammad [pbuh] ,\nAbu Lahab, who would shadow the Prophet’s steps crying aloud, \"O men, do not\nlisten to him for he is a liar; he is an apostate.\" Nevertheless, Muhammad [pbuh]\nmanaged to create a stir in the whole area, and even to convince a few people to\naccept his Call. [At- Tirmidhi; Masud Ahmad, 3/492,4/341]\nAttempts made to check the Onward March of Islam\nHaving fully perceived that Muhammad [pbuh] could never be desisted from his Call,\nQuraish, in a desperate attempt to quell the tidal wave of the Call, resorted to other\ncheap means acting from base motives:\n\n-- 55 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n56\n1. \tScoffing, degrading, ridiculing, belying and laughter- instigating cheap\nmanners, all of which levelled at the new converts in general, and the person\nof Muhammad [pbuh] in particular, with the aim of dragging the spirit of\ndespair into their morale, and slackening their ardent zealotry. They used to\ndenounce the Prophet [pbuh] as a man possessed by a jinn, or an insane\nperson:\n\"And they say: O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) to whom the \tDhikr \t(the Qur’? \t)\nhas been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man.\" [Al- Qur'an 15:6]\nor a liar practising witchcraft,\n\"And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh])\nhas come to them from among themselves! And the disbelievers say: \"This\n(Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is a sorcerer, a liar.\" [Al- Qur'an 38:4].\nTheir eyes would also look at the good man as if they would ‘eat him up’, or\ntrip him up, or disturb him from the position of stability or firmness. They\nused all sorts of terms of abuse ‘madman’ or ‘one possessed by an evil spirit’,\nand so on:\n\"And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes\nthrough hatreds when they hear the Reminder (the Qur’? \t), and they say:\nVerily, he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is a madman!\" [Al- Qur'an 68:51]\nAmongst the early converts, there was a group who had unfortunately no\nstrong clan at their back to support them. These innocent souls were ridiculed\nand jeered in season and out of season. Referring to such people, the\nhighbrow Quraish aristocrats used repeatedly to ask the Prophet [pbuh], with\njest and scorn:\n\"All? \thas favoured from amongst us?\" [Al- Qur'an 6:53]\nAnd All? \tsaid:\n\"Does not All? \tknow best those who are grateful?\" [Al- Qur'an 6:53]\nThe wicked used to laugh at the righteous in many ways:\na. \tThey would inwardly laugh at their Faith, because they felt themselves\nso superior.\nb. \tIn public places, when the righteous passed, they used to insult and\nwink at them,\nc. \tIn their own houses, they would run them down.\nd. \tWhenever and wherever they saw them, they reproached and called\nthem fools who had lost their way. In the Hereafter, all these tricks\nand falsehoods will be shown for what they are, and the tables will be\nreversed. All? \thad said:\n\n-- 56 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n57\n\"Verily! (During the worldly life) those who committed crimes used to laugh at\nthose who believed; and whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to\nanother (in mockery); and when they returned to their own people, they\nwould return jesting; and when they saw them, they said: ‘Verily! These have\nindeed gone astry!’ But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as\nwatchers over them (the believers).\" [Al- Qur'an 83:29- 33]\n2. \tDistorting Muhammad’s teachings, evoking ambiguities, circulating false\npropaganda; forging groundless alleg",
  "ations concerning his doctrines, person\nand character, and going to excess in such a manner in order to screen off\nany scope of sound contemplation from the public. With respect to the Qur’? \t,\nthey used to allege that it was:\n\"Tales of the ancients, which he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has written down, and\nthey are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\" [Al- Qur'an 25:5]\nThe iniquitous went on ceaselessly inculcating in people’s ears that the Qur’?\nwas not a true Revelation:\n\"This (the Qur’? \t) is nothing but a lie that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has\ninvented, and others have helped him at it.\" [Al- Qur'an 25:4]\nThe wicked would also attribute to men of All? \tjust such motives and springs\nof action as they themselves would be guilty of in such circumstances. The\npagans and those who were hostile to the revelation of All? \tand Islam, could\nnot understand how such wonderful verses could flow from the tongue of the\nProphet [pbuh] without having someone to teach, and claimed:\n\"It is only a human being who teaches him.\" [Al- Qur'an 16:103]\nThey also raised another baseless and superficial objection:\n\"Why does this Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) eat food and walk about in\nthe markets (like ourselves)?\" [Al- Qur'an 25:7]\nThey were sadly ignorant and painfully at fault for they could not perceive\nthat a teacher for mankind is one who shares their nature, mingles in their\nlife, is acquainted with their doings, and sympathises with their joys and\nsorrows.\nThe Noble Qur’? \thas vehemently refuted their charges and allegations and\nhas explained that the utterances of the Prophet [pbuh] are the Revelations\nof the Lord and their nature and contents provide a bold challenge to those\nwho attribute his Prophetic expressions to some base origin, at times to the\nmental throes of a dreaming reformer, at others to the effusion of a frenzied\npoet or the incoherent drivelling of an insane man.\n3. \tContrasting the Qur’? \twith the mythology of the ancients in order to distract\npeople’s interests from All? \t’s Words. Once An- Nadr bin Harith addressed the\nQuraishites in the following manner: \"O Quraish! You have experienced an\n\n-- 57 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n58\nunprecedented phenomenon before which you have so far been desperately\nhelpless. Muhammad [pbuh] grew up here among you and always proved to\nbe highly obliging, the most truthful and trustworthy young man. However,\nlater on when he reached manhood, he began to preach a new faith alien to\nyour society, and opposed to your liking so you began to denounce him at a\ntime as a sorcerer, at another as a soothsayer, a poet, or even an insane\nman. I swear by All? \the is not anyone of those. He is not interested in\nblowing on knots as magicians are, nor do his words belong to the world of\nsoothsaying; he is not a poet either, for his mentality is not that of a rambler,\nnor is he insane because he has never been witnessed to develop any sort of\nhallucinations or insinuations peculiar to madmen. O people of Quraish, it is\nreally a serious issue and I recommend that you reconsider your attitude.\"\nIt is narrated that An- Nadr, at a later stage, headed for Heerah where he got\nconversant with the traditions of the kings of Persia and the accounts of\npeople like Rustum and Asphandiar, and then returned to Makkah. Here he\nwould always shadow the Messenger’s steps in whatever audiences the later\nheld to preach the new faith and to caution people against All? \t’s wrath. An-\nNadr would directly follow the Prophet [pbuh] and narrate to the same\naudience long tales about those people of Persia. He would then always\nappend his talk with a question cunningly inquiring if he did not outdo\nMuhammad [pbuh].[Ibn Hisham 1/299,300,358; Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 4/8,9].\nIbn ‘Abbas [R] related that An- Nadr used to purchase songstresses who would\nthrough their bodily charms and songs entice away from Islam anyone\ndeveloping the least attachment to the Prophet [pbuh]; in this regard, All?\nsays:\n\"And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to\nmislead (men) from the Path of All? \t.\" [Al- Qur'an 31:6] [Tafheem- ul- Qur'an\n4/9]\n4. \tIn a fresh attempt to dissuade Muhammad [pbuh] from his principled stand,\nQuraish invited him to compromise on his teachings and come to terms with\ntheir pre- Islamic practices in such a way that he quits some of his religion and\nthe polytheists do the same. All? \t, the All- High says:\n5. \t\"They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with\nthem, so they (too) would compromise with you.\" [Al- Qur'an 68:9].\nOn the authority of Ibn Jareer and At- Tabarani, the idolaters offered that\nMuhammad [pbuh] worship their gods for a year, and they worship his Lord\nfor a year. In another version, they said: \"If you accept our gods, we would\nworship yours.\" Ibn Ishaq related that Al- Aswad bin Al- Muttalib, Al- Waleed\nbin Al- Mugheerah, Omaiyah bin Khalaf and Al- ‘As bin Wa’il As- Sahmy, a\nconstellation of influential polytheists, intercepted the Prophet [pbuh] while\nhe was circumambulating in the Holy Sanctuary, and offered him to worship\nthat they worshipped, and they worship that he worshipped so that, according\nto them, both parties would reach a common denominator. They added\n\"Should the Lord you worship prove to be better than ours, then it will be so\nmuch better for us, but if our gods proved to be better than yours, then you\nwould have benefit from it.\" All? \t, the Exalted, was decisive on the spot and\nrevealed the following Chapter:\n\n-- 58 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n59\n\"Say: \"O \tAl- K? \tir? \t(disbelievers in All? \t, in His Oneness, in His Angels, in His\nBooks, in His Messengers, in the Day of Resurrection, in \tAl- Qadar, etc.)! I\nworship not that which you worship, nor will you worship that which I\nworship. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping, nor will you\nworship that which I worship. To you be your religion, and to me my religion\n(Islamic Monotheism). [Al- Qur'an 109] [Ibn Hisham 1/362]\nPersecutions\nAt the beginning of the fourth year of the Call, and for a period of some months, the\npolytheists confined their harassment tactics to the above- mentioned ones. But on\nrealizing the futility of these procedures, they decided to organize a full- scale\nopposition campaign. They called for a general meeting and elected a committee of\ntwenty- five men of Quraish notables with Abu Lahab, the Prophet’s uncle, as a\nchairman. Following some lengthy deliberations, they reached a decisive decision to\nt ake measures deemed to stop the tidal wave of Islam through different channels.\nThey were determined to spare no effort, in combatting the new faith. They decided\nto malign the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] and put the new converts to different sorts\nof torture using all available resources. It was easy to put the resolutions relating to\nthe new converts who were deemed weak into effect. As for the Prophet [pbuh] , it\nwas not easy to malign him because he had such gravity, magnanimity and\nmatchless perfection of character that deterred even his enemies from committing\nany act of folly against him. He had, as well, Abu Talib, his uncle, who came from a\nnoble descent and had an awe- inspiring clan to support him. This situation was a\nsource of great worry to the infidels, but they felt that they could no longer exercise\npatience or show any tolerance before a formidable power marching steadily to annul\ntheir religious office and temporal authority.\nAbu Lahab himself took the initiative in the new series of persecutions, and started\nto mete out countless aspects of harmful deeds, hatred and spite against Muhammad\n[pbuh] . Starting with flinging stones at him, forcing his two sons to divorce their\nwives Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum, the Prophet’s daughters [Fi Zilal Al- Qur'an\n30/282; Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 6/522], gloating over him on his second son’s death\ncalling him ‘the man cut off with offspring’, and then shadowing his step during the\npilgrimage and forums seasons to belie him and entice the bedouins against him and\nhis Call [At- Tirmidhi]. His wife, Umm Jameel bint Harb, the sister of Abu Sufyan had\nalso her share in this ruthless campaign. She proved that she was not less than her\nhusband in the enmity and hatred she harboured for the Prophet [pbuh] . She used\nto tie bundles of thorns with ropes of twisted palm- leaf fibre and strew them about in\nthe paths which the Prophet [pbuh] was expected to take, in order to cause him\nbodily injury. She was a real shrew, bad- tempered with abusive language, highly\nskilled in the art of hatching intrigues, and enkindling the fire of discord and sedition.\nShe was deservedly stained as ‘the carrier of firewood’ in the Noble Qur’? \t. On\nreceiving this news, she directly proceeded to the Mosque with a handful of pebbles\nto hurl at the Prophet [pbuh] . All? \t, the Great, took away her sight and she saw only\nAbu Bakr who was sitting immediately next to the Prophet [pbuh]. She then\naddressed Abu Bakr most audaciously threatening to break his Companion’s mouth\nwith her handful of pebbles, and recited a line of verse pregnant with impudent\ndefiance: \"We have disobeyed the dispraised one, rejected his Call, and alienated\nourselves from his religion.\" When she had left, Abu Bakr turned to the Prophet\n\n-- 59 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n60\n[pbuh] and inquired about the matter. The Prophet [pbuh] assured him that she did\nnot see him because All? \thad taken away her sight.[Ibn Hisham 1/335]\nAbu Lahab and his household used to inflict those shameful examples of torture and\nharassment in spite of the blood relation that tied them for he was the Prophet’s\nuncle and both lived in two contiguous houses. Actually, few of the Prophet’s\nneighbours abstained from maligning him. They even threw the entrails of a goat on\nhis back while he was performing his prayers. He always used to complain about that\nunbecoming neighbourliness but to no avail for they were deeply indulged in error.\nAl- Bukhari, on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ud, narrated that once when the Prophet\n[pbuh] was prostrating himself while praying in Al- Ka‘bah, Abu Jahl asked his\ncompanions to bring the dirty foetus of a she- camel and place it on his back. ‘Uqbah\nbin Abi Mu‘ait was the unfortunate man who hastened to do this ignoble act. A peal\nof laughter rose amongst the infidels. In the meanwhile, Fatimah, the daughter of\nthe Prophet [pbuh], happened to pass that way. She removed the filth from her\nfather’s back. The Prophet [pbuh] invoked the wrath of All? \tupon them, especially\nupon Abu Jahl, ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a, Shaibah bin Rabi‘a, Al- Waleed bin ‘Utbah, Omaiyah\nbin Khalaf and ‘Uqbah bin Mu‘ait. It is recorded that all of them were killed in the\nbattle of Badr. [Bukhari 1/37]\nScandal- mongering and backbiting were also amongst the means of oppression that\nthe chiefs of Makkah, in general, and Omaiyah bin Khalaf, in particular, resorted to in\ntheir overall process of evil- doing. In this regard, All? \tsays:\n\"Woe to every slanderer and backbiter.\" [Al- Qur'an 104:1]\n‘Uqbah bin Al- Mu‘ait once attended an audience of the Prophet [pbuh] and listened to\nhim preaching Islam. A close friend of his, Ubai bin Khalaf, heard of this. He could\nnot tolerate any act of this sort, so he reproached ‘Uqbah and ordered him to spit in\nthe Prophet’s holy face, and he shamelessly did it. Ubai did not spare any thinkable\nway to malign the Prophet [pbuh] ; he even ground old decomposed bones and blew\nthe powder on him. Al- Akhnas bin Shuraique Ath- Thaqafi used to detract from the\ncharacter of the Prophet [pbuh] in season and out of season. The Noble Qur’? \t, in\ndirect reference to this man’s ignominious deeds, attached to him nine abominable\ntraits:\n\"And obey not everyone who swears much, — and is considered worthless, a\nslanderer, going about with calumnies, hinderer of the good, transgressor, sinful,\ncruel — after all that base- born (of illegitimate birth).\" [Al- Qur'an 68:10- 13] [Ibn\nHisham 1/356]\nAbu Jahl’s arrogance and haughtiness blocked all avenues that could produce the\nleast light of belief in his heart:\n\"So he (the disbeliever) neither believed (in this Qur’? \t, in the Message of\nMuhammad [pbuh]) nor prayed!\" [Al- Qur'an 75:31]\nHe, moreover, wanted to debar the Prophet [pbuh] from the Noble Sanctuary. It\nhappened once that the Prophet [pbuh] was praying within the precinct of the Sacred\nHouse, when Abu Jahl proceeded threateningly and uttering abusive language. The\n\n-- 60 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n61\nProphet [pbuh] chided him severely to which Abu Jahl answered back defiantly\nclaiming that he was the mightiest in Makkah; All? \tthen revealed:\n\"Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers).\" [Al- Qur'an 96:17]\nIn another version of the same incident, the Prophet [pbuh] took Abu Jahl by his\nneck, rocked him severely saying:\n\"Woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you! Again, woe to you\n[O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!\" [Al- Qur'an 75:34, 35].\nNotwithstanding this reproach, Abu Jahl would never wake up to himself nor did he\nrealize his foolish practices. On the contrary, he was determined to go to extremes,\nand swore he would dust the Messenger’s face and tread on his neck. No sooner had\nhe proceeded to fulfill his wicked intention than he was seen turning back shielding\nhimself with his hands (as if something horrible in his pursuit). His companions asked\nhim what the matter was. He said: \"I perceived a ditch of burning fire and some\nwings flying.\" Later on, the Messenger commented saying, \"If he had proceeded\nfurther, the angels would have plucked off his limbs one after another.\" [Fi Zilal Al-\nQur'an 29/312; Muslim]\nSuch was the disgraceful treatment meted out to the Prophet [pbuh], the great man,\nrespected as he was by his compatriots, with an influential man, his uncle Abu Talib,\nat his back to support him. If the matters were so with the Prophet [pbuh], what\nabout those people deemed weak with no clan to support them? Let us consider their\nsituation in some detail. Whenever Abu Jahl heard of the conversion of a man of high\nbirth with powerful friends, he would degrade his prudence and intellect, undermine\nhis judgement; and threaten him with dire consequences if he was a merchant. If the\nnew convert was socially weak, he would beat him ruthlessly and put him to\nunspeakable tortures. [Ibn Hisham 1/320]\nThe uncle of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan used to wrap ‘Uthman in a mat of palm leaves, and\nset fire under him. When Umm Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair heard of her son’s conversion, she\nput him to starvation and then expelled him from her house. He used to enjoy full\nluxurious easy life, but in the aftermath of the tortures he sustained, his skin got\nwizened, and he assumed a horrible physical appearance. [Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen\n1/57; Talqeeh Ahl- al- Athar p.60]\nBilal, the slave of Omaiyah bin Khalaf, was severely beaten by his master when the\nlatter came to know of his conversion to Islam. Sometimes a rope was put around\nhis neck and street boys were made to drag him through the streets and even across\nthe hillocks of Makkah. At times he was subjected to prolonged deprivation of food\nand drink; at others he was bound up, made to lie down on the burning sand and\nunder the crushing burden of heavy stones. Similar other measures were resorted to\nin order to force him to recant. All this proved in vain. He persisted in his belief in\nthe Oneness of All? \t. On one such occasion, Abu Bakr was passing by; moved by\npity, he purchased and emancipated him from slavery. [Ibn Hisham 1/317- 318;\nRahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/57]\nAnother victim of the highhandedness of Quraish was ‘Ammar bin Yasir, a freed slave\nof Bani Makhzoum. He, along with his mother and father, embraced Islam in its early\n\n-- 61 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n62\nphase. They were repeatedly made to lie on the burning sand and were beaten\nseverely. ‘Ammar was at times tossed up on embers. The Prophet [pbuh] was greatly\nmoved by the atrocities which were being perpetrated upon ‘Ammar and his family.\nHe always comforted them and raised his hand in prayer and said: \"Be patient, you\nwill verily find your abode in the Paradise.\" Yasir, the father, died because of\nrepeated tortures. Sumaiyah, ‘Ammar’s mother was bayoneted to death by Abu Jahl\nhimself, and thus merited the title of the first woman martyr in Islam. ‘Ammar\nhimself was subjected to various modes of torture and was always threatened to\nsustain severe suffering unless he abused Muhammad [pbuh] and recanted to Al- Lat\nand ‘Uzza. In a weak moment, he uttered a word construed as recantation though\nhis heart never wavered and he came back once to the Prophet [pbuh] , who\nconsoled him for his pain and confirmed his faith. Immediately afterwards the\nfollowing verse was revealed:\n\"Whoever disbelieved in All? \tafter his belief, except him who is forced thereto and\nwhose heart is at rest with Faith —.\" [Al- Qur'an 16:106]\nAbu Fakeeh, Aflah, a freed slave of Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar was the third of those helpless\nvictims. The oppressors used to fasten his feet with a rope and drag him in the\nstreets of Makkah. [Eijaz At- Tanzil p.53]\nKhabbab bin Al- Aratt was also an easy victim to similar outrages on every possible\noccasion. He experienced exemplary torture and maltreatment. The Makkan\npolytheists used to pull his hair and twist his neck, and made him lie on burning coal\nwith a big rock on his chest to prevent him from escaping. Some Muslims of rank and\nposition were wrapped in the raw skins of camels and thrown away, and others were\nput in armours and cast on burning sand in the scorching sun of Arabia. [Talqeeh\nFuhoom Ahl- al- Athar p.60; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/57]\nEven the women converts were not spared, and the list is too long to include all of\nthem. Zanirah, An- Nahdiyah and her daughter, Umm ‘Ubais and many others had\ntheir full share of persecution at the hand of the oppressors — ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab\nincluded — of course before his conversion to Islam. [Ibn Hisham 1/319]\nAbu Bakr, a wealthy believer, purchased and freed some of those she- slaves, just as\nhe did with regard to Bilal and ‘Amir bin Fuheirah.\nThe House of Al-Arqam\nIn the light of these inhuman persecutions, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it wise to\nadvise his followers to conceal their conversion, in both word and deed. He took the\ndecision to meet them secretly lest Quraish should get to know of his designs, and so\ntake measures that might foil his goals. He also had in mind to avoid any sort of\nopen confrontation with the polytheists because such a thing at this early stage\nwould not be in the interest of the newly- born Call, still vulnerable and not fully\nfledged. Once, in the fourth year of Prophethood, the Muslims were on their way to\nthe hillocks of Makkah to hold a clandestine meeting with the Prophet [pbuh], when\na group of polytheists did observe their suspicious movement and began to abuse\nand fight them. Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas beat a polytheist and shed his blood and thus\nrecorded the first instance of bloodshed in the history of Islam. [Ibn Hisham 1/263]\n\n-- 62 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n63\nThe Prophet [pbuh], on the other hand, used to proclaim the Islamic Faith and\npreach it openly with deep devotion and studious pursuit, but for the general welfare\nof the new converts and in consideration of the strategic interest of Islam, he took\nDar Al- Arqam, in As- Safa mountain, in the fifth year of his mission, as a temporary\ncentre to meet his followers secretly and instruct them in the Qur’? \tand in the\nIslamic wisdom.\nThe First Migration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia)\nThe series of persecutions started late in the fourth year of Prophethood, slowly at\nfirst, but steadily accelerated and worsened day by day and month by month until\nthe situation got so extremely grave and no longer tolerable in the middle of the fifth\nyear, that the Muslims began to seriously think of feasible ways liable to avert the\npainful tortures meted out to them. It was at that gloomy and desperate time that\nS? \tah Al- Kahf \t(Chapter 18 — The Cave) was revealed comprising definite answers to\nthe questions with which the polytheists of Makkah constantly pestered the Prophet\n[pbuh] . It comprises three stories that include highly suggestive parables for the\ntrue believers to assimilate. The story of the Companions of the Cave implies implicit\nguidance for the believers to evacuate the hot spots of disbelief and aggression\npregnant with the peril of enticement away from the true religion:\n\"(The young men said to one another): \"And when you withdraw from them, and\nthat which they worship, except All? \t, then seek refuge in the Cave, your Lord will\nopen a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e. will\ngive you what you will need of provision, dwelling, etc.)\" [Al- Qur'an 18:16].\nNext, there is the story of Al- Khidr (The Teacher of Arabia) and Moses [AWS] in a\nclear and delicate reference to the vicissitudes of life. Future circumstances of life are\nnot necessarily the products of the prevalent conditions, they might be categorically\nthe opposite. In other words, the war waged against the Muslims would in the future\nassume a different turn, and the tyrannous oppressors would one day come to suffer\nand be subjected to the same tortures to which the Muslims were then put.\nFurthermore, there is the story of Dhul- Qarnain (The Two Horned One), the powerful\nruler of west and east. This story says explicitly that All? \ttakes His righteous\nservants to inherit the earth and whatever in it. It also speaks that All? \traises a\nrighteous man every now and then to protect the weak against the strong.\nS? \tah Az- Zumar \t(Chapter 39 — The Crowds) was then revealed pointing directly to\nmigration and stating that the earth is spacious enough and the believers must not\nconsider themselves constrained by the forces of tyranny and evil:\n\"Good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and All? \t’s earth is\nspacious (so if you cannot worship All? \tat a place, then go to another)! Only those\nwho are patient shall receive their rewards in full without reckoning.\" [Al- Qur'an\n39:10].\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had already known that Ashamah Negus, king of Abyssinia\n(Ethiopia), was a fair ruler who would not wrong any of his subordinates, so he\npermitted some of his followers to seek asylum there in Abyssinia (Ethiopia).\n\n-- 63 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n64\nIn Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood, a group of twelve men and four women left\nfor Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Among the emigrants were ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan and his wife\nRuqaiyah (the daughter of the Prophet [pbuh]). With respect to these two emigrants,\nthe Prophet [pbuh] said:\n\" They are the first people to migrate in the cause of All? \tafter Abraham and Lot\n[AWS].\"\nThey sneaked out of Makkah under the heavy curtain of a dark night and headed for\nthe sea where two boats happened to be sailing for Abyssinia (Ethiopia), their\ndestination. News of their intended departure reached the ears of Quraish, so some\nmen were despatched in their pursuit, but the believers had already left Shuaibah\nPort towards their secure haven where they were received warmly and accorded due\nhospitality.\nIn Ramadan of the same year, the Prophet [pbuh] went into the Holy Sanctuary\nwhere there was a large host of Quraish polytheists, including some notables and\ncelebrities. Suddenly he began reciting \tS? \tah An- Najm \t(Chapter 41 — The Star). The\nawe- inspiring Words of All? \tdescended unawares upon them and they immediately\ngot stunned by them. It was the first time for them to be shocked by the truthful\nRevelation. It had formerly been the favourite trick of those people who wished to\ndishonour Revelation, not only not to listen to it themselves but also to talk loudly\nand insolently when it was being read, so that even the true listeners may not be\nable to hear. They used to think that they were drowning the Voice of All? \t; in fact,\nthey were piling up misery for themselves, for All? \t’s Voice can never be silenced,\n\"And those who disbelieve say:\n\"Listen not to this Qur’? \t, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you\nmay overcome.\" [Al- Qur'an 41:26].\nWhen the unspeakably fascinating Words of All? \tcame into direct contact with their\nhearts, they were entranced and got oblivious of the materialistic world around them\nand were caught in a state of full attentiveness to the Divine Words to such an\nextent that when the Prophet [pbuh] reached the stormy heart- beating ending:\n\"So fall you down in prostration to All? \tand worship Him (Alone).\" [Al- Qur'an 53:62]\nThe idolaters, unconsciously and with full compliance, prostrated themselves in\nabsolute god- fearing and stainless devotion. It was in fact the wonderful moment of\nthe Truth that cleaved through the obdurate souls of the haughty and the attitude of\nthe scoffers. They stood aghast when they perceived that All? \t’s Words had\nconquered their hearts and done the same thing that they had been trying hard to\nannihilate and exterminate. Their co- polytheists who had not been present on the\nscene reproached and blamed them severely; consequently they began to fabricate\nlies and calumniate the Prophet [pbuh] alleging that he had attached to their idols\ngreat veneration and ascribed to them the power of desirable intercession. All of\nthese were desperate attempts made to establish an excusable justification for their\nprostrating themselves with the Prophet [pbuh] on that day. Of course, this foolish\nand iniquitous slanderous behaviour was in line with their life- consecrated practice of\ntelling lies and plot hatching.\n\n-- 64 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n65\nNews of this incident was misreported to the Muslim emigrants in Abyssinia\n(Ethiopia). They were informed that the whole of Quraish had embraced Islam so\nthey made their way back home. They arrived in Makkah in Shawwal of the same\nyear. When they were only an hour’s travel from Makkah, the reality of the situation\nwas discovered. Some of them returned to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), others sneaked\nsecretly into the city or went in publicly but under the tutelage of a local notable.\nHowever, due to the news that transpired to the Makkans about the good hospitality\nand warm welcome that the Muslims were accorded in Abyssinia (Ethiopia), the\npolytheists got terribly indignant and started to mete out severer and more horrible\nmaltreatment and tortures to the Muslims. Thereupon the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh]\ndeemed it imperative to permit the helpless creatures to seek asylum in Abyssinia\n(Ethiopia) for the second time. Migration this time was not as easy as it was the\nprevious time, for Quraish was on the alert to the least suspicious moves of the\nMuslims. In due course, however, the Muslims managed their affairs too fast for the\nQuraishites to thwart their attempt of escape. The group of emigrants this time\ncomprised eighty three men and nineteen or, in some versions, eighteen women.\nWhether or not ‘Ammar was included is still a matter of doubt. [Tafheem- ul- Qur'an\n5/188; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 1/24; Ibn Hisham 1/364; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/61]\nQuraish’s Machination against the Emigrants\nQuraish could not tolerate the prospect of a secure haven available for the Muslims\nin Abyssinia (Ethiopia), so they despatched two staunch envoys to demand their\nextradition. They were ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a — before\nembracing Islam. They had taken with them valuable gifts to the king and his clergy,\nand had been able to win some of the courtiers over to their side. The pagan envoys\nclaimed that the Muslim refugees should be expelled from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and\nmade over to them, on the ground that they had abandoned the religion of their\nforefathers, and their leader was preaching a religion different from theirs and from\nthat of the king.\nThe king summoned the Muslims to the court and asked them to explain the\nteachings of their religion. The Muslim emigrants had decided to tell the whole truth\nwhatever the consequences were. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib stood up and addressed the\nking in the following words: \"O king! we were plunged in the depth of ignorance and\nbarbarism; we adored idols, we lived in unchastity, we ate the dead bodies, and we\nspoke abominations, we disregarded every feeling of humanity, and the duties of\nhospitality and neighbourhood were neglected; we knew no law but that of the\nstrong, when All? \traised among us a man, of whose birth, truthfulness, honesty,\nand purity we were aware; and he called to the Oneness of All? \t, and taught us not\nto associate anything with Him. He forbade us the worship of idols; and he enjoined\nus to speak the truth, to be faithful to our trusts, to be merciful and to regard the\nrights of the neighbours and kith and kin; he forbade us to speak evil of women, or\nto eat the substance of orphans; he ordered us to fly from the vices, and to abstain\nfrom evil; to offer prayers, to render alms, and to observe fast. We have believed in\nhim, we have accepted his teachings and his injunctions to worship All? \t, and not to\nassociate anything with Him, and we have allowed what He has allowed, and\nprohibited what He has prohibited. For this reason, our people have risen against us,\nhave persecuted us in order to make us forsake the worship of All? \tand return to\nt he worship of idols and other abominations. They have tortured and injured us, until\nfinding no safety among them, we have come to your country, and hope you will\nprotect us from oppression.\"\n\n-- 65 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n66\nThe king was very much impressed by these words and asked the Muslims to recite\nsome of All? \t’s Revelation. Ja‘far recited the opening verses of \tS? \tah Maryam\n(Chapter 19 — Mary) wherein is told the story of the birth of both John and Jesus\nChrist, down to the account of Mary having been fed with the food miraculously.\nThereupon the king, along with the bishops of his realm, was moved to tears that\nrolled down his cheeks and even wet his beard. Here, the Negus exclaimed: \"It\nseems as if these words and those which were revealed to Jesus are the rays of the\nlight which have ra",
  "diated from the same source.\" Turning to the crest- fallen envoys\nof Quraish, he said, \"I am afraid, I cannot give you back these refugees. They are\nfree to live and worship in my realm as they please.\"\nOn the morrow, the two envoys again went to the king and said that Muhammad\n[pbuh] and his followers blasphemed Jesus Christ. Again the Muslims were\nsummoned and asked what they thought of Jesus. Ja‘far again stood up and replied:\n\"We speak about Jesus as we have been taught by our Prophet [pbuh] , that is, he is\nthe servant of All? \t, His Messenger, His spirit and His Word breathed into Virgin\nMary.\" The king at once remarked, \"Even so do we believe. Blessed be you, and\nblessed be your master.\" Then turning to the frowning envoys and to his bishops\nwho got angry, he said: \"You may fret and fume as you like but Jesus is nothing\nmore than what Ja‘far has said about him.\" He then assured the Muslims of full\nprotection. He returned to the envoys of Quraish, the gifts they had brought with\nthem and sent them away. The Muslims lived in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) unmolested for\na number of years till they returned to Madinah. [Ibn Hisham 1/334- 338]\nIn this way Quraish’s malicious intentions recoiled on them and their machination\nmet with utter failure. They came to fully realize that the grudge they nursed against\nhe Muslims would not operate but within their realm of Makkah. They consequently\nbegan to entertain a horrible idea of silencing the advocate of the new Call once and\nfor all, through various channels of brutality, or else killing him. An obstinate\ndifficulty, however, used to curtail any move in this direction embodied by the\nProphet’s uncle Abu Talib and the powerful social standing he used to enjoy as well\nas the full protection and support he used to lend to his nephew. The pagans of\nMakkah therefore decided to approach Abu Talib for the second time and insisted\nthat he put a stop to his nephew’s activities, which if allowed unchecked, they said,\nwould involve him into severe hostility. Abu Talib was deeply distressed at this open\nthreat and the breach with his people and their enmity, but he could not afford to\ndesert the Messenger too. He sent for his nephew and told him what the people had\nsaid, \"Spare me and yourself and put not burden on me that I can’t bear.\" Upon this\nthe Prophet [pbuh] thought that his uncle would let him down and would no longer\nsupport him, so he replied:\n\"O my uncle! by All? \tif they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left on\ncondition that I abandon this course, until All? \thas made me victorious, or I perish\ntherein, I would not abandon it.\" The Prophet [pbuh] got up, and as he turned away,\nhis uncle called him and said, \"Come back, my nephew,\" and when he came back, he\nsaid, \"Go and preach what you please, for by All? \tI will never forsake you.\"\nHe then recited two lines of verse pregnant with meanings of full support to the\nProphet [pbuh] and absolute gratification by the course that his nephew had chalked\nout in Arabia. [Ibn Hisham 1/265]\n\n-- 66 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n67\nOnce more Quraish approaches Abu Talib\nQuraish, seeing that the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] was still intent on his Call,\nrealized that Abu Talib would never forsake his nephew even if this incurred their\nenmity. Some of them then went to see him once more taking with them a youth\ncalled ‘Amarah bin Al- Waleed bin Al- Mugheerah, and said, \"O Abu Talib! we have\nbrought you a smart boy still in the bloom of his youth, to make use of his mind and\nstrength and take him as your son in exchange for your nephew, who has run\ncounter to your religion, brought about social discord, found fault with your way of\nlife, so that we kill him and rid you of his endless troubles; just man for man.\" Abu\nTalib’s reply was, \"It is really an unfair bargain. You give me your son to bring him\nup and I give you my son to kill him! By All? \t, it is something incredible!!\" Al- Mut‘im\nbin ‘Adi, a member of the delegation, interrupted saying that Quraish had been fair\nin that bargain because \"they meant only to rid you of that source of hateful trouble,\nbut as I see you are determined to refuse their favours.\" Abu Talib, of course, turned\ndown all their offers and challenged them to do whatever they pleased.[Ibn Hisham\n1/266] Historical resources do not give the exact date of these two meetings with\nAbu Talib. They, however, seem more likely to have taken place in the sixth year of\nProphethood with a brief lapse of time in between.\nThe Tyrants’ Decision to kill the Prophet [pbuh]\nNow that all the schemes and conspiracies of Quraish had failed, they resorted to\ntheir old practices of persecution and inflicting tortures on the Muslims in a more\nserious and brutal manner than ever before. They also began to nurse the idea of\nkilling the Prophet [pbuh] . In fact, contrary to their expectations, this new method\nand this very idea served indirectly to consolidate the Call to Islam and support it\nwith the conversion of two staunch and mighty heroes of Makkah, i.e. Hamzah bin\n‘Abdul- Muttalib and ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab[R] .\n‘Utaibah bin Abi Lahab once approached the Prophet [pbuh] and most defiantly and\nbrazenly shouted at him, \"I disbelieve in: \"By the star when it goes down.\" [53:1]\nand in \"Then he (Gabriel) approached and came closer.\" [53:8] In other words: \"I do\nnot believe in any of the Qur’? \t.\" He then started to deal highhandedly with\nMuhammad [pbuh] and laid violent hand on him, tore his shirt and spat into his face\nbut his saliva missed the Holy face of the Prophet [pbuh] . Thereupon, the Prophet\n[pbuh] invoked All? \t’s wrath on ‘Utaibah and supplicated:\n\"O All? \t! Set one of Your dogs on him.\"\nAll? \tresponded positively to Muhammad’s supplication, and it happened in the\nfollowing manner: Once ‘Utaibah with some of his compatriots from Quraish set out\nfor Syria and took accommodation in Az- Zarqa’. There a lion approached the group\nto the great fear of ‘Utbah, who at once recalled Muhammad’s words in supplication,\nand said: \"Woe to my brother! This lion will surely devour me just as Muhammad\n[pbuh] supplicated. He has really killed me in Syria while he is in Makkah.\" The lion\ndid really rush like lightning, snatched ‘Utbah from amongst his people and crushed\nhis head. [Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 6/522; Quoted from Al- Isti'ab, Al- Isaba, Dala'il An-\nNubuwwah, etc]\n\n-- 67 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n68\nIt is also reported that a wretched idolater from Quraish, named ‘Uqbah bin ‘Abi\nMu‘ait once trod on the Prophet’s neck while he was prostrating himself in prayer\nuntil his eyes protruded. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.113]\nMore details reported by Ibn Ishaq testify to the tyrants’ deeply- established\nintentions of killing the Prophet [pbuh] . Abu Jahl, the archenemy of Islam, once\naddressed some of his accomplices: \"O people of Quraish! It seems that Muhammad\n[pbuh] is determined to go on finding fault with our religion, degrading our\nforefathers, discrediting our way of life and abusing our gods. I bear witness to our\ngod that I will carry a too heavy rock and drop it on Muhammad’s head while he is in\nprostration to rid you of him, once and for all. I am not afraid of whatever his sept,\nBanu ‘Abd Munaf, might do.\" The terrible unfortunate audience endorsed his plan\nand encouraged him to translate it into a decisive deed.\nIn the morning of the following day, Abu Jahl lay waiting for the arrival of the\nMessenger of All? \t[pbuh] to offer prayer. The people of Quraish were in their\nassembly rooms waiting for news. When the Prophet [pbuh] prostrated himself, Abu\nJahl proceeded carrying the big rock to fulfill his wicked intention. No sooner had he\napproached closer to the Prophet [pbuh] than he withdraw pale- faced, shuddering\nwith his hands strained the rock falling off. Thereupon, the people watching hurried\nforward asking him what the matter was. He replied: \"When I approached, a male-\ncamel unusual in figure with fearful canines intercepted and almost devoured me.\"\nIbn Ishaq reported that the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of his comment on the\nincident, said \"It was Gabriel[AWS] , if Abu Jahl had approached closer, he would\nhave killed him.[Ibn Hisham 1/298]\" Even so the tyrants of Quraish would not be\nadmonished, contrariwise, the idea of killing the Prophet [pbuh] was still being\nnourished in their iniquitous hearts. On the authority of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As,\nsome people of Quraish were in a place called Al- Hijr complaining that they had been\ntoo patient with the Prophet [pbuh] , who suddenly appeared and began his usual\ncircumambulation. They started to wink at him and utter sarcastic remarks but he\nremained silent for two times, then on the third, he stopped and addressed the\ninfidels saying:\n\"O people of Quraish! Hearken, I swear by All? \tin Whose Hand is my soul, that you\nwill one day be slaughtered to pieces.\" As soon as the Prophet [pbuh] uttered his\nword of slaughter, they all stood aghast and switched off to a new style of language\nsmacking of fear and even horror trying to soothe his anger and comfort him saying:\n\"You can leave Abul Qasim, for you have never been foolish.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/289]\n‘Urwa bin Az- Zubair narrated: I asked Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As to tell me of the\nworst thing that the pagans did to the Prophet [pbuh] . He said: \"While the Prophet\n[pbuh] was praying in Al- Hijr of Al- Ka‘bah, ‘Uqbah bin Al- Mu‘ait came and put his\ngarment around the Prophet’s neck and throttled him violently. Abu Bakr came and\ncaught him by his shoulder and pushed him away from the Prophet [pbuh] and said:\n\"Do you want to kill a man just because he says, My Lord is All? \t?\" [Bukhari 1/544]\nThe Conversion of Hamzah bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib\nIn a gloomy atmosphere infested with dark clouds of iniquity and tyranny, there\nshone on the horizon a promising light for the oppressed, i.e. the conversion of\nHamzah bin ‘Abdul- Muttalib in Dhul Hijjah, the sixth year of Prophethood. It is\nrecorded that the Prophet [pbuh] was one day seated on the hillock of Safa when\n\n-- 68 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n69\nAbu Jahl happened to pass by and accused the religion preached by him. Muhammad\n[pbuh] , however, kept silent and did not utter a single word. Abu Jahl went on\nunchecked, took a stone and cracked the Prophet’s head which began to bleed. The\naggressor then went to join the Quraishites in their assembly place. It so happened\nthat shortly after that, Hamzah, while returning from a hunting expedition, passed by\nthe same way, his bow hanging by his shoulder. A slave- girl belonging to ‘Abdullah\nbin Jada‘an, who had noted the impertinence of Abu Jahl, told him the whole story of\nthe attack on the Prophet [pbuh] . On hearing that, Hamzah was deeply offended\nand hurried to Al- Ka‘bah and there, in the courtyard of the Holy Sanctuary, found\nAbu Jahl sitting with a company of Quraishites. Hamzah rushed upon him and struck\nhis bow upon his head violently and said: \"Ah! You have been abusing Muhammad\n[pbuh] ; I too follow his religion and profess what he preaches.\" The men of Bani\nMakhzum came to his help, and men of Bani Hashim wanted to render help, but Abu\nJahl sent them away saying: \"Let Abu ‘Ummarah alone, by All? \tI did revile his\nnephew shamelessly.[Ibn Hisham 1/291; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/68; Mukhtasar\nSeerat Ar- Rasool p.66]\" In fact, Hamzah’s conversion derived initially from the pride\nof a man who would not accept the notion of others humiliating his relative. Later on,\nhowever, All? \tpurified his nature and he managed to grasp the most trustworthy\nhand- hold (Faith in All? \t). He proved to be a source of great strength to the Islamic\nFaith and its followers. [Mushtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.101]\nThe Conversion of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab\nAnother significant addition to the strength of Islam was the conversion of ‘Umar bin\nAl- Khattab in Dhul- Hijjah, the sixth year of Prophethood, three days following the\nconversion of Hamzah.[Tareekh 'Umar bin Al- Kattab, p.11] He was a man of\ndauntless courage and resolution, feared and respected in Makkah, and hitherto a\nbitter opponent of the new religion. The traditional account reveals that the Prophet\n[pbuh] once raised his hands in prayer and said:\n\"O All? \t! Give strength to Islam especially through either of two men you love more:\n‘Umar bin Al- Khattab or Abu Jahl bin Hisham.\"\n‘Umar, obviously, was the one who merited that privilege. [At- Tirmidhi 2/209]\nWhen we scrutinize the several versions that speak of ‘Umar’s conversion, we can\nsafely conclude that various contradictory emotions used to conflict with one another\nwithin his soul. On the one hand, he used to highly regard the traditions of his\npeople, and was habituated to the practice of indulgence in wine orgies; on the other\nhand, he greatly admired the stamina of the Muslims and their relentless dedication\nto their faith. These two extreme views created a sort of skepticism in his mind and\nmade him at times tend to believe that the doctrines of Islam could bear better and\nmore sacred seeds of life, that is why he would always experience fits of outrage\ndirectly followed by unexpected enervation.[Fiqh As- Seerah, p92,93] On the whole,\nthe account of his conversion is very interesting and requires us to go into some\ndetails.\nOne day, ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab set out from his house, and headed for the Holy\nSanctuary where he saw the Prophet [pbuh] offering prayer and overheard him\nreciting the \tS? \tah Al- H? \tqah \t(Chapter 69 — The Reality) of the Noble Qur’? \t. The\nWords of All? \tappealed to him and touched the innermost cells of his heart. He felt\n\n-- 69 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n70\nthat they derived from unusual composition, and he began to question his people’s\nallegations as regards the man- composed poetry or words of a soothsayer that they\nused to attach to the Noble Qur’? \t. The Prophet [pbuh] went on to recite:\n\"That this is verily the word of an honoured Messenger (i.e. Gabriel or Muhammad\n[pbuh] which he has brought from All? \t). It is not the word of a poet, little is that\nyou believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you\nremember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the ‘Alamin \t(mankind,\njinns and all that exists).\" [Al- Qur'an 69:40- 43]\nAt that very moment, Islam permeated his heart.[Tareekh 'Umar bin Al- Khattab p.6]\nHowever, the dark layer of pre- Islamic tendencies, the deep- seated traditional\nbigotry as well as the blind pride in his forefathers overshadowed the essence of the\ngreat Truth that began to feel its way reluctantly into his heart. He, therefore,\npersisted in his atrocities against Islam and its adherents unmindful of the pure and\ntrue- to- man’s nature feeling that lay behind that fragile cover of pre- Islamic\nignorance and mentality. His sharp temper and excessive enmity towards the\nProphet [pbuh] led him one day to leave his house, sword in hand, with the intention\nof killing the Prophet [pbuh] . He was in a fit of anger and was fretting and fuming.\nNu‘aim bin ‘Abdullah, a friend of ‘Umar’s, met him accidentally half way. What had\ncaused so much excitement in him and on whom was the fury to burst, he inquired\ncasually. ‘Umar said furiously: \"To destroy the man Muhammad ([pbuh]) this\napostate, who has shattered the unity of Quraish, picked holes in their religion,\nfound folly with their wise men and blasphemed their gods.\" \"‘Umar, I am sure, your\nsoul has deceived you, do you think that Banu ‘Abd Munaf would let you walk on\nearth if you slain Muhammad [pbuh]? Why don’t you take care of your own family\nfirst and set them right?\"\n\"Which of the folk of my house?\" asked ‘Umar angrily. \"Your brother- in- law and your\nsister have apostatized (meaning to say: They have become followers of Muhammad\n[pbuh]) and abandoned your religion.\"\n‘Umar directed his footsteps to his sister’s house. As he drew near, he heard the\nvoice of Khabbab bin Aratt, who was reading the Qur’? \tic Chapter \tT?H?/i> (mystic\nletters, T. H.) to both of them. Khabbab, perceiving the noise of his footsteps retired\nto a closet. Fatimah, ‘Umar’s sister, took hold of the leaf and hid it. But ‘Umar had\nalready heard the voice. \"What sound was that I have heard just now?\" shouted the\nson of Khattab, entering angrily. Both his sister and her husband replied, \"You heard\nnothing.\" \"Nay,\" said he swearing fiercely, \"I have heard that you have apostatized.\"\nHe plunged forward towards his brother- in- law and beat him severely, but Fatimah\nrushed to the rescue of her husband. Thereupon, ‘Umar fell upon his sister and\nstruck upon her head. The husband and wife could not contain themselves and cried\naloud: \"Yes, we are Muslims, we believe in All? \tand His Messenger Muhammad\n[pbuh] so do what you will.\" When ‘Umar saw the face of his dear sister besmeared\nwith blood, he was softened and said: \"Let me see what you were reading, so that I\nmay see what Muhammad [pbuh] has brought.\" Fatimah was satisfied with the\nassurance, but said: \"O brother, you are unclean on account of your idolatry, none\nbut the pure may touch it. So go and wash first.\" He did so, and took the page and\nread the opening verses of the Chapter T?H?/i> until he reached:\n\n-- 70 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n71\n\"Verily! I am All? \t! L?il? \ta illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so\nworship Me and offer prayers perfectly (Iq? \tat- as- Sal? \t), for My Remembrance.\" [Al-\nQur'an 20:14].\n‘Umar read the verses with great interest and was much entranced with them. \"How\nexcellent it is, and how graceful! Please guide me to Muhammad [pbuh] .\" said he.\nAnd when he heard that, Khabbab came out of concealment and said, \"O ‘Umar, I\nhope that All? \thas answered the prayer of the Prophet [pbuh] , for I heard him say:\n‘O All? \t! Strengthen Islam through either ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab or Abu Jahl bin\nHisham.’\" ‘Umar then left for a house in Safa where Muhammad [pbuh] had been\nholding secret meetings along with his Companions. ‘Umar reached that place with\nthe sword swinging by his arm. He knocked at the door. The Companions of the\nProphet [pbuh] turned to see who the intruder was. One of them peeped through a\nchink in the door and reeled back exclaiming: \"It is ‘Umar with his sword.\" Hamzah,\ndispelling the fears of his friends, said: \"Let him in. As a friend he is welcome. As a\nfoe, he will have his head cut off with his own sword.\" The Prophet [pbuh] asked his\nCompanions to open the door. In came the son of Khattab. The Prophet [pbuh]\nadvanced to receive the dreadful visitor, caught him by his garment and scabbard,\nand asked him the reason of his visit. At that ‘Umar replied: \"O Messenger of All?\n[pbuh] , I come to you in order to believe in All? \tand his Messenger and that which\nhe has brought from his Lord.\" Filled with delight, Muhammad [pbuh] together with\nhis Companions, cried aloud: ‘All? \tu Akbar’ (All? \tis Great). [Tareekh 'Umar bin Al-\nKhattab, p7- 11; Ibn Hisham 1/343]\nThe conversion of ‘Umar was a real triumph for the cause of Islam. So great and\ninstant was the effect of his conversion on the situation that the believers who had\nhitherto worshipped All? \twithin their four walls in secret now assembled and\nperformed their rites of worship openly in the Holy Sanctuary itself. This raised their\nspirits, and dread and uneasiness began to seize Quraish.\nIbn Ishaq narrated on the authority of ‘Umar [R], \"When I embraced Islam, I\nremembered the archenemy of Muhammad [pbuh] , i.e. Abu Jahl. I set out, and\nknocked at his door. When he came out to see me, I told him directly that I had\nembraced Islam. He immediately slammed the door repulsively denouncing my move\nas infamous and my face as ugly.\" In fact, ‘Umar’s conversion created a great deal of\nstir in Makkah that some people denounced him as an apostate, yet he would never\nwaver in Faith, on the contrary, he persisted in his stance even at the peril of his life.\nThe polytheists of Quraish marched towards his house with the intention of killing\nhim. ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar [R] narrated: While ‘Umar was at home in a state of fear,\nthere came Al- ‘As bin Wa’il As- Sahmy Abu ‘Amr, wearing an embroidered cloak and a\nshirt having silk hems. He was from the tribe of Bani Sahm who were our allies\nduring the pre- Islamic period of ignorance. Al- ‘As said to ‘Umar: What’s wrong with\nyou? He said: Your people claim that they will kill me if I become a Muslim. Al- ‘As\nsaid: Nobody will harm you after I have given protection to you. So Al- ‘As went out\nand met the people streaming in the whole valley. He said: Where are you going?\nThey replied: We want son of Al- Khattab who has embraced Islam. Al- ‘As said: There\nis no way for anybody to touch him. So the people retreated. [Bukhari 1/545; Ibn\nHisham 1/349]\nWith respect to the Muslims in Makkah, ‘Umar’s conversion had a different\ntremendous impact. Mujahid, on the authority of Ibn Al- ‘Abbas [R], related that he\n\n-- 71 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n72\nhad asked ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab why he had been given the epithet of Al- Farouque\n(he who distinguishes truth from falsehood), he replied: After I had embraced Islam,\nI asked the Prophet [pbuh]: ‘Aren’t we on the right path here and Hereafter?’ The\nProphet [pbuh] answered: ‘Of course you are! I swear by All? \tin Whose Hand my\nsoul is, that you are right in this world and in the hereafter.’ I, therefore, asked the\nProphet [pbuh] ‘Why we then had to conduct clandestine activism. I swear by All?\nWho has sent you with the Truth, that we will leave our concealment and proclaim\nour noble cause publicly.’ We then went out in two groups, Hamzah leading one and\nI the other. We headed for the Mosque in broad daylight when the polytheists of\nQuraish saw us, their faces went pale and got incredibly depressed and resentful. On\nthat very occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] attached to me the epithet of Al- Farouque.\nIbn Mas‘ud [R] related that they (the Muslims) had never been able to observe their\nreligious rites inside the Holy Sanctuary except when ‘Umar embraced Islam. [Ibn\nHisham; Tareekh 'Umar bin Al- Khattab, p.13; Mukhtasar As- Seerah p.103]\nSuhaib bin Sinan [R], in the same context, said that it was only after ‘Umar’s\nconversion, that we started to proclaim our Call, assemble around and\ncircumambulate the Sacred House freely. We even dared retaliate against some of\nthe injustices done to harm us. In the same context, Ibn Mas‘ud said: We have been\nstrengthened a lot since ‘Umar embraced Islam.\nQuraish’s Representative negotiates with the Messenger of All? \t[pbuh]\nShortly after the conversion of these two powerful heroes, Hamzah bin ‘Abdul-\nMuttalib and ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab[R] , the clouds of tyranny and oppression started\nto clear away and the polytheists realized that it was no use meting out torture to\nthe Muslims. They consequently began to direct their campaign to a different course.\nThe authentic records of the biography of the Prophet [pbuh] show that it had\noccurred to the Makkan leaders to credit Muhammad [pbuh] with ambition. They,\ntherefore, time and again plied him with temptation. One day some of the important\nmen of Makkah gathered in the enclosure of Al- Ka‘bah, and ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a, a chief\namong them, offered to approach the Prophet [pbuh] and contract a bargain with\nhim whereby they give him whatever worldly wealth he asks for, on condition that he\nkeep silent and no longer proclaim his new faith. The people of Quraish endorsed his\nproposal and requested him to undertake that task. ‘Utbah came closer to\nMuhammad [pbuh] and addressed him in the following words:\nWe have seen no other man of Arabia, who has brought so great a calamity to a\nnation, as you have done. You have outraged our gods and religion and taxed our\nforefathers and wise men with impiety and error and created strife amongst us. You\nhave left no stone unturned to estrange the relations with us. If you are doing all this\nwith a view to getting wealth, we will join together to give you greater riches than\nany Quraishite has possessed. If ambition moves you, we will make you our chief. If\nyou desire kingship we will readily offer you that. If you are under the power of an\nevil spirit which seems to haunt and dominate you so that you cannot shake off its\nyoke, then we shall call in skilful physicians to cure you.\n\"Have you said all?\" asked Muhammad [pbuh]; and then hearing that all had been\nsaid, he spoke forth, and said:\n\n-- 72 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n73\n\"In the Name of All? \t, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \tH?M? \t. [These letters\nare one of the miracles of the Qur’? \t, and none but All? \t(Alone) knows their\nmeanings]. A revelation from All? \t, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A Book\nwhereof the verses are explained in detail; — a Qur’? \tin Arabic for people who\nknow. Giving glad tidings [of Paradise to the one who believes in the Oneness of All?\n(i.e. Islamic Monotheism) and fears All? \tmuch (abstains from all kinds of sins and\nevil deeds.) and loves All? \tmuch (performing all kinds of good deeds which He has\nordained)], and warning (of punishment in the Hell- fire to the one who disbelieves in\nthe Oneness of All? \t), but most of them turn away, so they listen not. And they say:\nOur hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us …\" [Al-\nQur'an 41: 1- 5]\nThe Messenger of All? \t[pbuh] went on reciting the Chapter while ‘Utbah sitting and\nlistening attentively with his hand behind his back to support him. When the\nMessenger reached the verse that required prostration, he immediately prostrated\nhimself. After that, he turned to ‘Utbah saying: \"Well Abu Al- Waleed! You have heard\nmy reply, you are now free to do whatever you please.\" ‘Utbah then retired to his\ncompany to apprise them of the Prophet’s attitude. When his compatriots saw him,\nthey swore that he had returned to them with a countenance unlike the one he had\nbefore meeting the Prophet [pbuh] . He immediately communicated to them the\ndetails of the talk he gave and the reply he received, and appended saying: \"I have\nnever heard words similar to those ones he recited. They definitely relate neither to\npoetry nor to witchcraft nor do they derive from soothsaying. O people of Quraish! I\nrequest you to heed my advice and grant the man full freedom to pursue his goals,\nin which case you could safely detach yourselves from him. I swear that his words\nbear a supreme Message. Should the other Arabs rid you of him, they will then spare\nyou the trouble, on the other hand if he accedes to power over the Arabs, then you\nwill bask in his kingship and share him his might.\" These words of course fell on deaf\nears, and did not appeal to the infidels, who jeered at ‘Utbah and claimed that the\nProphet [pbuh] had bewitched him. [Ibn Hisham 1/293,294]\nIn another version of the same event, it is related that ‘Utbah went on attentively\nlistening to the Prophet [pbuh] until the latter began to recite All? \t’s Words:\n\"But if they turn away, they say (O Muhammad [pbuh] ): \"I have warned you of a\nSa‘iqa \t(a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunder- bolt) like the \tSa‘iqa \twhich\novertook ‘Ad and Tham? \t(people).\" [Al- Qur'an 41:13]\nHere ‘Utbah stood up panicked and stunned putting his hand on the Prophet’s mouth\nbeseeching him: \"I beg you in the Name of All? \tand uterine ties to stop lest the\ncalamity should befall the people of Quraish.\" He then hurriedly returned to his\ncompatriots and informed them of what he had heard. [Tafseer Ibn Kathir 6/159-\n161]\nAbu Talib assembles Bani Hashim and Bani Al-Muttalib\nThe new and welcome changes notwithstanding, Abu Talib still had a deep sensation\nof fear over his nephew. He deliberated on the previous series of incidents including\nthe barter affair of ‘Amarah bin Al- Waleed, Abu Jahl’s rock, ‘Uqbah’s attempt to\nchoke the Prophet [pbuh] , and finally ‘Umar’s (before conversion) intention to kill\n\n-- 73 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n74\nMuhammad [pbuh] . The wise man understood that all of these unequivocally\nsmacked of a serious plot being hatched to disregard his status as a custodian of the\nProphet [pbuh] , and kill the latter publicly. In the event of such a thing, Abu Talib\ndeeply believed, neither ‘Umar nor Hamzah would be of any avail, socially powerful\nthough they were. [Ibn Hisham 1/269; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.106]\nAbu Talib was right. The polytheists had laid a carefully- studied plan to kill the\nProphet [pbuh] , and banded together to put their plan into effect. He, therefore,\nassembled his kinsfolk of Bani Hashim and Bani Al- Muttalib, sons of ‘Abd Munaf and\nexhorted them to immunize and defend his nephew. All of them, whether believers\nor disbelievers, responded positively except his brother Abu Lahab, who sided with\nthe idolaters.\n\n-- 74 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n75\nGeneral Social Boycott\nFour events of special significance occurred within less than four weeks — the\nconversion of Hamzah, the conversion of ‘Umar, Muhammad’s [pbuh] refusal to\nnegotiate any sort of compromise and then the pact drawn up between Banu\nMuttalib and Banu Hashim to immunize Muhammad [pbuh] and shield him against\nany treacherous attempt to kill him. The polytheists were baffled and at a loss as to\nwhat course they would follow to rid themselves of this obstinate and relentless\nobstacle that had appeared to shatter to pieces their whole tradition of life. They had\nalready been aware that if they killed Muhammad [pbuh] their blood would surely\nflow profusely in the valleys of Makkah and they would certainly be exterminated.\nTaking this dreadful prospect into consideration, they grudgingly resorted to a\ndifferent iniquitous course that would not imply murder.\nA Pact of Injustice and Aggression\nThe pagans of Makkah held a meeting in a place called Wadi Al- Muhassab, and\nformed a confederation hostile to both Bani Hashim and Bani Al- Muttalib. They\ndecided not to have any business dealings with them nor any sort of inter- marriage.\nSocial relations, visits and even verbal contacts with Muhammad [pbuh] and his\nsupporters would discontinue until the Prophet [pbuh] was given up to them to be\nkilled. The articles of their procl",
  "amation, which had provided for merciless measures\nagainst Bani Hashim, were committed to writing by an idolater, Bagheed bin ‘Amir\nbin Hashim and then suspended in Al- Ka‘bah. The Prophet [pbuh] invoked Allâh’s\nimprecations upon Bagheed, whose hand was later paralysed. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/46]\nAbu Talib wisely and quietly took stock of the situation and decided to withdraw to a\nvalley on the eastern outskirts of Makkah. Banu Hashim and Banu Al- Muttalib, who\nfollowed suit, were thus confined within a narrow pass (Shi‘b of Abu Talib), from the\nbeginning of Muharram, the seventh year of Muhammad’s mission till the tenth year,\nviz., a period of three years. It was a stifling siege. The supply of food was almost\nstopped and the people in confinement faced great hardships. The idolaters used to\nbuy whatever food commodities entered Makkah lest they should leak to the people\nin Ash- Shi‘b, who were so overstrained that they had to eat leaves of trees and skins\nof animals. Cries of little children suffering from hunger used to be heard clearly.\nNothing to eat reached them except, on few occasions, some meagre quantities of\nfood were smuggled by some compassionate Makkans. During ‘the prohibited\nmonths’ — when hostilities traditionally ceased, they would leave their confinement\nand buy food coming from outside Makkah. Even then, the food stuff was unjustly\noverpriced so that their financial situation would fall short of finding access to it.\nHakeem bin Hizam was once on his way to smuggle some wheat to his aunt Khadijah\n[R]Ç when Abu Jahl intercepted and wanted to debar him. Only when Al- Bukhtari\nintervened, did Hakeem manage to reach his destination. Abu Talib was so much\nconcerned about the personal safety of his nephew. Whenever people retired to\nsleep, he would ask the Prophet [pbuh] to lie in his place, but when all the others fell\nasleep, he would order him to change his place and take another, all of which in an\nattempt to trick a potential assassin.\nDespite all odds, Muhammad [pbuh] persisted in his line and his determination and\ncourage never weakened. He continued to go to Al- Ka‘bah and to pray publicly. He\n\n-- 75 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n76\nused every opportunity to preach to outsiders who visited Makkah for business or on\npilgrimage during the sacred months and special seasons of assemblies.\nThis situation ultimately created dissension amongst the various Makkan factions,\nwho were tied with the besieged people by blood relations. After three years of\nblockade and in Muharram, the tenth year of Muhammad’s mission, the pact was\nbroken. Hisham bin ‘Amr, who used to smuggle some food to Bani Hashim secretly at\nnight, went to see Zuhair bin Abi Omaiyah Al- Makhzoumy and reproached him for\nresigning to that intolerable treatment meted out to his uncles in exile. The latter\npleaded impotence, but agreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that\nwould secure the extrication of the exiles. On the ground of motivation by uterine\nrelations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and\ndeclare all relevant clauses null and void. They were Hisham bin ‘Amr, Zuhair bin Abi\nOmaiya, Al- Mut‘im bin ‘Adi, Abu Al- Bukhtari and Zam‘a bin Al- Aswad. They decided\nto meet in their assembly place and start their self- charged mission from the very\nprecinct of the Sacred House. Zuhair, after circumambulating seven times, along\nwith his colleagues approached the hosts of people there and rebuked them for\nindulging in the amenities of life whereas their kith and kin of Bani Hashim were\nperishing on account of starvation and economic boycott. They swore they would\nnever relent until the parchment of boycott was torn to piece and the pact broken at\nonce. Abu Jahl, standing nearby, retorted that it would never be torn. Zam‘a was\ninfuriated and accused Abu Jahl of telling lies, adding that the pact was established\nand the parchment was written without seeking their approval. Al- Bukhtari\nintervened and backed Zam‘a. Al- Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Hisham bin ‘Amr attested to\nthe truthfulness of their two companions. Abu Jahl, with a cunning attempt to\nliquidate the hot argument that was running counter to his malicious goals, answered\nthat the issue had already been resolved sometime and somewhere before.\nAbu Talib meanwhile was sitting in a corner of the Mosque. He came to communicate\nto them that a Revelation had been sent to his nephew, the Prophet [pbuh] to the\neffect that ants had eaten away all their proclamation that smacked of injustice and\naggression except those parts that bore the Name of Allâh. He contended that he\nwould be ready to give Muhammad [pbuh] up to them if his words proved untrue,\notherwise, they would have to recant and repeal their boycott. The Makkans agreed\nto the soundness of his proposition. Al- Mut‘im went to see the parchment and there\nhe did discover that it was eaten away by ants and nothing was left save the part\nbearing (in the Name of Allâh).\nThe proclamation was thus abrogated, and Muhammad [pbuh] and the other people\nwere permitted to leave Ash- Sh‘ib and return home. In the context of this trial to\nwhich the Muslims were subjected, the polytheists had a golden opportunity to\nexperience a striking sign of Muhammad’s Prophethood (the white ants eating away\nthe parchment) but to their miserable lot they desisted and augmented in disbelief:\n\"But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say ‘This is continuous magic.\"\n[Al- Qur'an 54:2] [Bukhari (in several chapters); Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/46; Ibn Hisham\n1/350]\n\n-- 76 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n77\nThe Final Phase of the Diplomacy of Negotiation\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left his confinement and went on preaching his Faith\nas usual. Quraish, likewise, repealed the boycott but went on in their atrocities and\noppression on the Muslims. Abu Talib, the octogenarian notable, was still keen on\nshielding his nephew but by that time, and on account of the series of tremendous\nevents and continual pains, he began to develop certain fits of weakness. No sooner\nhad he emerged victorious from the inhuman boycott, than he was caught in a\npersistent illness and physical enervation. The polytheists of Makkah, seeing this\nserious situation and fearing that the stain of infamy that the other Arabs could\nattribute to them in case they took any aggressive action against the Prophet [pbuh]\nafter he had lost his main support, Abu Talib, took a decision to negotiate with the\nProphet [pbuh] once more and submit some concessions withheld previously. They\nthen delegated some representatives to see Abu Talib and discuss the issue with\nhim. Ibn Ishaq and others related: \"When a serious illness caught Abu Talib, the\npeople of Quraish began to deliberate on the situation and reviewed the main\nfeatures that characterized that period and which included the conversion of ‘Umar\nand Hamzah to Islam, coupled with the tremendous stir that Muhammad [pbuh] had\ncreated amongst all the tribes of Quraish. They then deemed it imperative to see\nAbu Talib before he died to pressure his nephew to negotiate a compromise on the\nvarious disputed points. They were afraid that the other Arabs might attribute to\nthem the charge of opportunism.\"\nThe delegation of Quraish comprised 25 men including notables like ‘Utbah bin\nRabi‘a, Shaibah bin Rabi‘a, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, Omaiyah bin Khalaf, Abu Sufyan bin\nHarb. They first paid tribute to him and confirmed their high esteem of his person\nand position among them. They then shifted to the new give- and- take policy that\nthey claimed they wanted to follow. To substantiate their argument they alleged that\nthey would refrain from intervening in his religion if he did the same.\nAbu Talib summoned his nephew and apprised him of the minutes of his meeting\nwith them, and said: \"Well, my nephew, here are the celebrities of your people. They\nhave proposed this meeting to submit a policy of mutual concessions and peaceful\ncoexistence.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to them saying:\n\"I will guide you to the means by which you will gain sovereignty over both\nthe Arabs and non- Arabs.\"\nIn another version, the Prophet [pbuh] addressed Abu Talib in the following words:\n\"O uncle! Why don’t you call them unto something better?\" Abu Talib asked him,\n\"What is it that you invite them to?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied, \"I invite them to\nhold fast to a Message that is bound to give them access to kingship over the Arabs\nand non- Arabs.\" According to Ibn Ishaq’s version, \"It is just one word that will give\nyou supremacy over the Arabs and non- Arabs.\" The Makkan deputies were taken by\nincredible surprise and began to wonder what sort of word was that which would\nbenefit them to that extent. Abu Jahl asked, \"What is that word? I swear by your\nfather that we will surely grant you your wish followed by ten times as much.\" He\nsaid, \"I want you to testify that there is no god worthy to be worshipped but Allâh,\nand then divest yourselves of any sort of worship you harbour for any deities other\nthan Allâh.\" They immediately clapped their hands in ridicule, and said \"How can you\nexpect us to combine all the deities in one God. It is really something incredible.\" On\ntheir way out leaving, they said to one another, \"By god this man (Muhammad\n\n-- 77 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n78\n[pbuh] ) will never relent, nor will he offer any concessions. Let us hold fast to the\nreligion of our forefathers, and Allâ h will in due course adjudicate and settle the\ndispute between us and him.\" As regards this incident, Allâh revealed the following\nverses:\n\" \tSâd: [These letters (Sâd, etc.) are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân and\nnone but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings]. By the Qur’ân full of\nreminding. Nay, those who disbelieve are in false pride and Apposition. How\nmany a generation We have destroyed before them, and they cried out\nwhen there was no longer time for escape! And they (Arab pagans) wonder\nthat a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) has come to them from among\nthemselves! And the disbelievers say, ‘This (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is\na sorcerer, a liar. Has he made the gods (all) into One God (Allâh). Verily,\nthis is a curious thing!’ And the leaders among them went about (saying):\n‘Go on, and remain constant to your gods! Verily, this is a thing designed\n(against you)! We have not heard (the like) of this among the people of\nthese later days. This is nothing but an invention.’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 38:1- 7] [Ibn\nHisham 1/417- 419; Tafheem- ul- Qur'an 4/316; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.9]\n\n-- 78 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n79\nThe Year of Grief\nAbu Talib’s Death\nIn Rajab[Tareekh Al- Islam 1/120], the tenth year of the Prophethood, Abu Talib fell\nill and passed away, six months after leaving the confinement at Ash- Sh‘ib. In\nanother version, Abu Talib breathed his last in Ramadan, three days prior to the\ndeath of Khadijah [R] . On the authority of Al- Musaiyab, when Abu Talib was on the\ndeath bed, the Prophet [pbuh] entered the room where he saw Abu Jahl and\n‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah. He requested his uncle:\n\"My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no true god but Allâh,\nand I will bear testimony before Allâh (of your being a believer)\".\nAbu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah addressing him said: \"Abu Talib, would you\nabandon the religion of ‘Abdul- Muttalib?\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] constantly\nrequested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same\nstatement (of Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah) — till Abu Talib gave his final\ndecision and he stuck to the religion of ‘Abdul- Muttalib and refused to profess that\nthere is no true god but Allâh. Upon this the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked:\n\"By Allâh, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so\n(by Allâh)\".\nIt was then that Allâh, the Magnificent and Glorious revealed this verse:\n\"It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s\nforgiveness for the \tMushrikûn \t(polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers\nin the Oneness of Allâh) even though they be of kin, after it has become\nclear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a\nstate of disbelief).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:113]\nAnd it was said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]:\n\"Verily! You (O Muhammad [pbuh]) guide not whom you like.\" \t[Al- Qur'an\n28:56] [Bukhari 1/548]\nIt goes without saying that Abu Talib was very much attached to Muhammad [pbuh]\n. For forty years, Abu Talib had been the faithful friend — the prop of his childhood,\nthe guardian of his youth and in later life a very tower of defence. The sacrifices to\nwhich Abu Talib exposed himself and his family for the sake of his nephew, while yet\nincredulous of his mission, stamp his character as singularly noble and unselfish. The\nProphet [pbuh] did his best to persuade his octogenarian uncle to make profession of\nt he true faith, but he remained obdurate and stuck to the paganism of his\nforefathers, and thus could not achieve complete success. Al- ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-\nMuttalib narrated that he said to the Prophet [pbuh] \"You have not been of any avail\nto your uncle (Abu Talib) (though) by Allâh, he used to protect you and get angry on\nyour behalf.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"He is in a shallow fire, and had it not been\nfor me, he would have been at the bottom of the (Hell) Fire.\" [Bukhari 1/548]\n\n-- 79 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n80\nAbu Sa‘id Al- Khudri narrated that he heard the Prophet [pbuh] say, when the\nmention of his uncle was made, \"I hope that my intercession may avail him, and he\nbe placed in a shallow fire that rises up only to his heels.\" [Bukhari 1/548]\nKhadijah passes away to the Mercy of Allâh\nOnly two months after the death of his uncle, did the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nexperience another great personal loss viz., the Mother of believers, his wife\nKhadijah passed away in Ramadan of the tenth year of his Prophethood, when she\nwas sixty- five years old, and he was fifty [Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl- al- Athar p.7;\nRahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/164]. Khadijah was in fact a blessing of Allâh for the\nProphet [pbuh] . She, for twenty- five years, shared with him the toils and trials of\nlife, especially in the first ten years of his ministry of Prophethood. He deeply\nmourned over her death, and once he replied in an honest burst of tender emotions:\n\"She believed in me when none else did. She embraced Islam when people\ndisbelieved me. And she helped and comforted me in her person and wealth\nwhen there was none else to lend me a helping hand. I had children from\nher only.\"[Musnad Imam Ahmad 6/118]\nAbu Hurairah reported that Gabriel came to Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] and said:\n\"Allâh’s Messenger, lo, Khadijah is coming to you with a vessel of seasoned food or\ndrink. When she comes to you, offer her greetings from her Lord, and give her glad\ntidings of a palace of jewels in Paradise where there is no noise and no toil.\" [Bukhari\n1/539]\nThese two painful events took place within a short lapse of time and added a lot to\nhis grief and suffering. The Makkans now openly declared their campaign of torture\nand oppression. The Prophet [pbuh] lost all hope of bringing them back to the right\npath, so he set out for Al- Ta’if seeking a supportive atmosphere. But there too, he\nwas disappointed and he sustained unbearable tortures and maltreatment that far\noutweighed his miserable situation in his native town.\nHis Companions were on equal footing subjected to unspeakable torture and\nunbearable oppression to such an extent that his closest friend, Abu Bakr, to escape\npressure, fled out of Makkah and wanted to leave for Abyssinia (Ethiopia) if it were\nnot for Ibn Ad- Daghanah who met him at Bark Al- Ghamad and managed to dissuade\nhim from completing his journey of escape and brought him back under his\nprotection. [Bukhari 1/552; Ibn Hisham 1/372]\nThe death of Abu Talib rendered the Prophet [pbuh] vulnerable, and the polytheists\navailed them of that opportunity to give free rein to their hatred and highhandedness\nand to translate them in terms of oppression and physical tortures. Once an insolent\nQuraishite intercepted him and sprinkled sand on his head. When he arrived home, a\ndaughter of his washed the sand away and wept. \"Do not weep, my daughter. Allâh\nwill verily protect your father.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said. [Ibn Hisham 1/416]\nRapid succession of misfortunes, led the Prophet [pbuh] to call that period, ‘the year\nof grief and mourning’. Thenceforth, that year bore that appellation.\n\n-- 80 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n81\nHis Marriage to Sawdah [R] in Shawwal, the tenth year of Prophethood\nThe death of Khadijah left the Prophet [pbuh] lonely. The name of Sawdah was\nsuggested to him for marriage which he accepted. This lady had suffered many\nhardships for the sake of Islam. She was an early convert to the Islamic Faith and it\nwas by her persuasion that her husband had embraced Islam. On the second\nemigration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), Sawdah had accompanied her husband As- Sakran\nbin ‘Amr. He died on their way back to Makkah leaving her in a terrible state of\ndestitution. She was the first woman for the Prophet [pbuh] to marry after the death\nof Khadijah. Some years later she granted her turn with the Prophet [pbuh] to her\nco- wife, ‘Aishah. [Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl- al- Athar p.10; Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 2/165]\n\n-- 81 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n82\nThe Third Phase: Calling unto Islam beyond Makkah\nIn Shawwal [Tareekh- e- Islam 1/122] (in the last of May or in the beginning of June\n619 A.D.), ten years after receiving his mission from his Lord, the Prophet [pbuh] set\nout towards At- Ta’if, about 60 kilometres from Makkah, in the company of his freed\nslave Zaid bin Haritha inviting people to Islam. But contrary to his expectations, the\ngeneral atmosphere was terribly hostile. He approached the family of ‘Umair, who\nwere reckoned amongst the nobility of the town. But, to his disappointment, all of\nthem turned deaf ear to his message and used abusive language as regards the\nnoble cause he had been striving for. Three brothers from the chieftains of Thaqeef\n—‘Abd Yaleel, Mas‘ud and Habeeb — sons of ‘Amr bin ‘Umair Ath- Thaqafy met the\nProphet [pbuh], who invited them to embrace Islam and worship Allâh, but they\nimpudently jeered at him and refused his invitation. \"He is tearing the cloths of Al-\nKa‘bah; is it true that Allâh has sent you as a Messenger?\" said one of them. \"Has\nnot Allâh found someone else to entrust him with His Message?\" said the second. \"I\nswear by Allâh that I will never have any contact with you. If you are really the\nMessenger of Allâh, then you are too serious to retort back; and if you are belying\nAllâh, then I feel it is imperative not to speak to.\" said the third. The Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh], finding that they were hopeless cases, stood up and left them saying:\n\"Should you indulge in these practices of yours, never divulge them to me.\"\nFor ten days he stayed there delivering his message to several people, one after\nanother, but all to no purpose. Stirred up to hasten the departure of the unwelcome\nvisitor, the people hooted him through the alley- ways, pelted him with stones and\nobliged him to flee from the city pursued by a relentless rabble. Blood flowed down\nboth his legs; and Zaid, endeavouring to shield him, was wounded in the head. The\nmob did not desist until they had chased him two or three miles across the sandy\nplains to the foot of the surrounding hills. There, wearied and exhausted, he took\nrefuge in one of the numerous orchards, and rested against the wall of a vineyard. At\na time when the whole world seemed to have turned against him, Muhammad\n[pbuh] turned to his Lord and betook himself to prayer and the following touching\nwords are still preserved as those through which his oppressed soul gave vent to its\ndistress. He was weary and wounded but confident of the help of his Lord:\n\"O Allâh! To You alone I make complaint of my helplessness, the paucity of\nmy resources and my insignificance before mankind. You are the most\nMerciful of the mercifuls. You are the Lord of the helpless and the weak, O\nLord of mine! Into whose hands would You abandon me: into the hands of\nan unsympathetic distant relative who would sullenly frown at me, or to the\nenemy who has been given control over my affairs? But if Your wrath does\nnot fall on me, there is nothing for me to worry about.\"\n\"I seek protection in the light of Your Countenance, which illuminates the\nheavens and dispels darkness, and which controls all affairs in this world as\nwell as in the Hereafter. May it never be that I should incur Your wrath, or\nthat You should be wrathful to me. And there is no power nor resource, but\nYours alone.\"\nSeeing him in this helpless situation, Rabi‘a’s two sons, wealthy Makkans, were\nmoved on grounds of kinship and compassion, and sent to him one of their Christian\nservants with a tray of grapes. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted the fruit with pious\ninvocation: \"In the Name of the Allâh.\" The Christian servant ‘Addas was greatly\n\n-- 82 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n83\nimpressed by these words and said: \"These are words which people in this land do\nnot generally use.\" The Prophet [pbuh] inquired of him whence he came and what\nreligion he professed. ‘Addas replied: \"I am a Christian by faith and come from\nNineveh.\" The Prophet [pbuh] then said: \"You belong to the city of the righteous\nJonah, son of Matta.\" ‘Addas asked him anxiously if he knew anything about Jonah.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] significantly remarked: \"He is my brother. He was a Prophet and\nso am I.\" Thereupon ‘Addas paid homage to Muhammad [pbuh] and kissed his\nhands. His masters admonished him at this act but he replied: \"None on the earth is\nbetter than he is. He has revealed to me a truth which only a Prophet can do.\" They\nagain reprimanded him and said: \"We forewarn you against the consequences of\nabandoning the faith of your forefathers. The religion which you profess is far better\nthan the one you feel inclined to.\"\nHeart- broken and depressed, Muhammad [pbuh] set out on the way back to Makkah.\nWhen he reached Qarn Al- Manazil, Allâh, the Almighty sent him Gabriel together with\nthe angel of mountains. The latter asked the Prophet [pbuh] for permission to bury\nMakkah between Al–Akhshabain —Abu Qubais and Qu‘ayqa‘an mountains. Full\nnarration of this event was given by ‘Aishah [R] (the Prophet’s spouse). She said: \"I\nasked the Prophet [pbuh] if he had ever experienced a worse day than Uhud. He\nanswered that he had suffered a lot from those people (the idolaters) but the most\npainful was on the day of ‘Aqabah. I went seeking support from Ibn ‘Abd Yalil bin\n‘Abd Kalal, but he spurned me. I set out wearied and grieved heedless of anything\naround me until I suddenly realized I was in Qarn Ath- Tha‘alib, called Qarn Al-\nManazil. There, I looked up and saw a cloud casting its shade on me, and Gabriel\naddressing me: Allâh has heard your people’s words and sent you the angel of\nmountains to your aid. The latter called and gave me his greetings and asked for my\npermission to bury Makkah between Al- Akhshabain, the two mountains flanking\nMakkah. I said in reply that I would rather have someone from their loins who will\nworship Allâh, the All–Mighty with no associate.\" A concise meaningful answer fully\nindicative of the Prophet’s matchless character and the fathomless magnanimous\nmanners. [Bukhari 1/458; Muslim 2/109]\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then came back to wakefulness and his heart was set\nat rest in the light of that invisible Divinely provided aid. He proceeded to Wadi\nNakhlah where he stayed for a few days.\nDuring his stay there, Allâh sent him a company of jinns who listened to him reciting\nthe Noble Qur’ân:\n\"And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad [pbuh]) \tNafran\n(three to ten persons) of the jinns, (quietly) listening to the Qur’ân, when\nthey stood in the presence thereof, they said: ‘Listen in silence!’ And when it\nwas finished, they returned to their people, as warners. They said: ‘O our\npeople! Verily! We have heard a Book (this Qur’ân) sent down after Moses,\nconfirming what came before it, it guides to the Truth and to a Straight Path\n(i.e. Islam). O our people! Respond (with obedience) to Allâh’s Caller (i.e.\nAllâh’s Messenger Muhammad [pbuh]), and believe in him (i.e. believe in\nthat which Muhammad [pbuh] has brought from Allâh and follow him). He\n(Allâh) will forgive you of your sins, and will save you from a painful\ntorment (i.e. Hell- fire).’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 46:29- 31]\nThe same incident is referred to in \tSûrah \tAl- Jinn:\n\n-- 83 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n84\n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): \"It has been revealed to me that a group\n(from three to ten in number) of jinns listened (to this Qur’ân). They said:\n‘Verily! We have heard a wonderful Recital (this Qur’ân)! It guides to the\nRight Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in\nworship) anything with our Lord (Allâh).’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 72:1,2] … Till the end of\nthe 15th verse.\nFrom the context of these verses and their relevant interpretation, we can safely\nestablish it that the Prophet [pbuh] was not aware of the presence of that group of\njinns. It was only when Allâh revealed those verses that he came to know of it. The\nverses also confirm that it was the first time they came. However, the context of the\ndifferent versions suggests that the jinns repeated their visits later on. The presence\nof that company of jinns comes in the context of the Divine support given to His\nMessenger, and constitutes a propitious sign of ultimate victory and success for the\nCall of Islam. It provides an unshakable proof that no power however mighty could\nalter what is wrought by Allâh:\n\"And whosoever does not respond to Allâh’s Caller, he cannot escape on\nearth, and there will be no \tAuliyâ \t(protectors) from him besides Allâh (from\nAllâh’s punishment). Those are in manifest error.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 46:32]\n\"And we think that we cannot escape (from the punishment of) Allâ h in the\nearth, nor can we escape (from the punishment) by flight.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 72:12]\nGiven this support and auspicious start, depression, dismay and sadness that used to\nbeset him since he was driven out of At- Ta’if, he turned his face towards Makkah\nwith fresh determination to resume his earlier plan to expose people to Islam and\ncommunicate his Message in a great spirit of zeal and matchless enthusiasm.\nZaid bin Harithah, his companion, addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"How dare\nyou step into Makkah after they (Quraish) have expatriated you?\" The Prophet\n[pbuh] answered: \"Hearken Zaid, Allâh will surely provide relief and He will verily\nsupport His religion and Prophet.\"\nWhen he was a short distance from Makkah, he retired to Hira’ Cave. Whence he\ndespatched a man from Khuza‘ah tribe to Al- Akhnas bin Shuraiq seeking his\nprotection. The latter answered that he was Quraish’s ally and in no position to offer\nprotection. He despatched the messenger to Suhail bin ‘Amr, but to no avail, either.\nAl- Mut‘im bin ‘Adi, a notable in Makkah, however, volunteered to respond to the\nProphet’s appeal for shelter. He asked his people to prepare themselves fully armed\nand then asked Muhammad [pbuh] to enter into the town and directly into the Holy\nSanctuary. The Prophet [pbuh] observed a two- \tRak‘a \tprayer and left for his house\nguarded by the heavily- armed vigilant ‘Adi’s.\nIt has been reported that later Abu Jahl, the archenemy of Islam, asked Mut‘im if his\nbehaviour suggested protection or conversion, the latter replied it was merely\nprotection. Abu Jahl was relieved and said that he would give Muhammad protection\nfor his sake.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] never forgot Mut‘im’s favour. At the conclusion of the\nbattle of Badr, he declared publicly that if Mut‘im had been still alive and asked for\nthe release of the Quraishite captives, he would not deny him his request. [Ibn\n\n-- 84 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n85\nHisham 1/419- 422; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/46; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.14; Rahmat-\nal- lil'alameen 1/71- 74; Tareekh- e- Islam 1/123]\nIslam being introduced to Arabian Tribes and Individuals\nIn Dhul Qa‘dah, the tenth year of Prophethood, i.e. July 619, the Prophet [pbuh],\nreturned to Makkah to resume his activities. The time for pilgrimage to Makkah was\napproaching so he hastened to introduce people both tribes and individuals to Islam\nand call upon them to embrace it, just as it was his practice since the fourth year of\nhis Prophethood.\nOn the authority of Az- Zuhri, of the tribes that Islam was introduced to, we could\nspeak of Banu ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘ah, Muharib bin Khasfa, Fazarah, Ghassan, Murrah,\nHaneefah, Saleem, ‘Abs, Banu Nasr, Banu Al- Buka’, Kindah, Kalb, Al- Harith bin Ka‘b,\nUdhrah and people of Hadrmout. Islam was not introduced to them in one single\nyear but rather repeatedly from the fourth year till the last pre- migration season of\npilgrimage. They however, remained obdurate and none of them responded\npositively. [At- Tirmidhi; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.149; Tareekh- e- Islam 1/125]\nThe following is a resume of aspects relating to the Prophet’s appeals as regards the\nnew faith he was preaching:\n1. \tHe visited a sept of Banu Kalb known as Banu ‘Abdullah. He called them to\nAllâh’s Message and entreated them to accept it for the sake of Allâh Who had\nchosen a beautiful name for their father, but without avail.\n2. \tHe called on Bani Haneefah in their habitation, but received very repugnant\ntreatment.\n3. \tHe addressed Bani ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘ah in their encampment, calling them to\nabandon idolatry and join him. One of them called Buhairah bin Firras,\nanswered him back: \"Should we give you allegiance and Allâh give you power\nover your opponents, will you give us right to inheritance and succeed you in\npower?\" The Prophet replied: \"The whole affair lies in Allâh’s Hands. He gives\nthe power to whomever He desires.\" The man commented: \"Do you expect us\nto incur the wrath and vengeance of the Arabs without the least hope of\nleadership? We can in fact readily dispense with your offers.\"\nWhen Banu ‘Amir returned to their habitations, ",
  "they narrated the story to an elderly\nman who had lingered behind because he was too old. They told him, \"A young man\nof Quraish of Bani ‘Abdul Muttalib, claiming that he is a Prophet, contacted us, asked\nfor support and invited us to embrace his religion.\" The old sheikh was struck by the\nnews, and wondered if there was no way of making amends for the loss of that\nopportunity and swore, \"He is really Ishmaelite (he descends from Ishmael). He is\nthe Truth (he is a real Prophet). How did it happen that you misjudged his words?\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was not dismayed at all. He persisted in his mission for the\nfulfillment of which he had been commissioned to strive despite all odds. He did not\nconfine his efforts to the tribes but also conducted contacts with individuals from\nsome of whom he was able to receive a favourable response. Moreover, later in the\nsame season, some of them did believe in his Prophethood and entered the fold of\nIslam. The following list included some of those early converts:\n\n-- 85 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n86\n1. \tSwaid bin Samit. He was an intelligent discreet poet from Yathrib\n(Madinah). During his stay in Makkah for pilgrimage (or lesser pilgrimage), he\nencountered the Prophet [pbuh] who invited him to embrace Islam. At this\ninvitation, Swaid imparted to the Prophet some sound words from Luqman’s\nwisdom. The Prophet approved of that wisdom but told the man that he had\nsomething far better. He recited some verses from the Qur’ân, the man\nlistened meditatively and the words appealed to his originally pure nature and\naccepted Islam as his faith at once. He was killed in the battle of Bu‘ath. That\nwas in the eleventh year of the Prophethood. [Ibn Hisham 1/425; Rahmat- al-\nlil'alameen 1/74]\n2. \tEyas bin Mu‘adh. \tHe was still a youth from Aws tribe. He came as a member\nof delegation seeking alliance with Quraish against another rival tribe dwelling\nin Madinah, Al- Khazraj. The Prophet [pbuh] met them and advised them to\nfollow a better course than that they had in mind. He introduced himself and\nIslam to them, apprised them of his mission and narrated some verses from\nthe Noble Qur’ân. Eyas’s heart immediately absorbed the Divine Message and\nagreed with the Prophet [pbuh]. Abul Haisar Anas bin Rafi‘, a member of the\ndelegation disapproved of the boy’s behaviour and silenced him by hurling\nsome dust into his face. The people then left Madinah after having failed in\nestablishing alliance with Quraish. Shortly after arrival in Madinah, the boy\nbreathed his last acclaiming Allâh’s Name and celebrating His Glory.[Ibn\nHisham 1/424; Tareekh- e- Islam 1/126]\n3. \tAbu Dhar Al- Ghifari. \tHe used to live in the suburbs of Yathrib. News of the\nIslamization of Swaid bin Samit and Eyas bin Mu‘adh reached him and\nconstituted a turning point in his life per se. He sent his brother to Makkah for\nmore details about the Prophet’s intentions. The man came back and reported\nto Abu Dhar that the ‘said man’ enjoined good and forbade evil. Abu Dhar was\nnot satisfied and decided that he himself should go out and probe the real\nsituation. After some attempts to identify the person of the Prophet [pbuh],\nhe managed to meet him though not without some difficulties due to the\nantagonistic atmosphere within which the proponents of the new faith were\ntrying to work their way. No sooner than Abu Dhar was exposed to the real\nnature of Islam, he embraced it. Despite the Prophet’s earnest plea not to\ndivulge his new move, Abu Dhar went directly to the Holy Sanctuary where he\npublicly declared that he had testified to the Oneness of Allâh and\nProphethood of Muhammad. The heathens all around hurried and began\nbeating him. He almost died when Al- ‘Abbas intervened warning against\nkilling someone whose tribe was in full command of the strategic commercial\ncaravan routes leading to Makkah. The event recurred in the following\nmorning with the same man to come to the scene and rescue him.[Bukhari\n1/449- 544]\n4. \tTufail bin ‘Amr Ad- Dausi. \tHe was an honest poet and chief of Ad- Daus tribe\ninhabiting an area close to Yemen in South Arabia. He arrived in Makkah in\nthe eleventh year of Prophethood. Great reception ceremonies were accorded\nto him on his advent. The Makkans soon started to inculcate in his ears all\nsorts of antipathy against the Prophet [pbuh]. They even alleged that he had\ncaused the most horrible societal schism, dividing all sorts of social life even\nthe family ties were subject to his schemes and plans of dissension. They\neven warned him against speaking or even listening to him. The man\noverpowered by these pleas, complied by their requests. He even stuffed his\nears with a piece of cotton in order not to hear any word of his. However,\nwhen this tribesman entered the mosque, he saw Muhammad [pbuh]\n\n-- 86 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n87\nobserving his prayer and out of curiosity, he approached him for it was a\nDivine Will to hear the Prophet’s sound and appealing words. The temptation\nto hear more was irresistible so he followed the Prophet [pbuh] into his\nhouse, briefed him on his advent and all the story of the people of Quraish.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] recited some verses of the Noble Qur’ân and\nthe man managed to taste something exceptionally beautiful and discern the\ntruth latent within. He embraced Islam and testified that there was no god\nbut Allâh and that Muhammad was His Messenger. He then said that he was\nan influential man among his people and that he would call them to profess\nIslam, yet he wanted the Prophet [pbuh] to equip him with a supportive sign\nthat would ease his future task. It was in fact a Divinely bestowed light in his\nwhip. He called his father and wife to embrace Islam and they did respond.\nHis people lagged a little but he exhorted them fervently and was fully\nsuccessful. He and seventy or eighty of his followers emigrated to Madinah\nafter the Trench Battle. He was a perfect fighter in the cause of Allâh and was\nmartyred in Al- Yamama events.[Ibn Hisham 1/385; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-\nRasool p.144]\n5. \tDhumad Al- Azdi. \tHe came from Azd Shanu’a in Yemen, specialist in\nincantation. He arrived in Makkah to hear the fools there say that Muhammad\n[pbuh] was out of his mind. He decided to practise his craft on the Prophet\n[pbuh], who on seeing him said: \"Praise is to Allâh, we entertain His praise\nand seek His help. Whomsoever Allâh guides, none will lead astray, and\nwhomsoever Allâh leads astray, none will guide. I testify there is no god but\nAllâh and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.\" Dhumad heard the\nwords and requested the Prophet [pbuh] to echo them again, and he was\ngranted his wish thrice. Here he said: \"I have heard the soothsayers,\nsorcerers and poets, but never have I experienced the sweetness of your\nwords.\" He then gave a pledge of a sincere convert. [Mishkat Al- Masabeeh\n2/525]\nHope inspiring Breezes from the Madinese\nIt was during the pilgrimage season, in the eleventh year of Prophethood, that the\nIslamic Call found the righteous seeds through which it would grow up to constitute\ntall trees whose leaves would foster the new faith and shelter the new vulnerable\nconverts from the blows of injustices and high- handness of Quraish. It was the\nProphet’s wise practice to meet the delegates of the Arabian tribes by night so that\nthe hostile Makkans would not debar him from achieving his objectives.[Tareekh- e-\nIslam p.129] In the company of his two truthful Companions ‘Ali and Abu Bakr, he\nhad an interesting talk regarding Islamization with Bani Dhuhal, but the latter\nsuspended their conversion.[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.150] In pursuit of the\nsame objective, the Prophet and his Companions passed by ‘Aqabat Mina where they\nheard people talking. They went at their heels until they encountered six men from\nYathrib, all of whom from Khazraj tribe: As‘ad bin Zurarah, ‘Awf bin Harith, Rafi‘ bin\nMalik, Qutbah bin ‘Amir, ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir and Jabir bin ‘Abdullah. The last two being\nfrom Aws and the former four from Khazraj.\nThe Madinese always heard the Jews say that a Prophet was about to rise, for the\ntime for a new dispensation had arrived. Him they would follow and then smite their\nenemies as the children of ‘Ad and Iram had been smitten. [Rahmat- al- lil'alameen\n1/84; Ibn Hisham 1/429; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/50]\n\n-- 87 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n88\n\"Of what tribe are you?\" asked the Prophet. \"Of the tribe of Khazraj,\" they replied.\n\"Are you the allies of the Jews?\" The Prophet enquired. They said: \"Yes.\" \"Then why\nnot sit down for a little and I will speak to you.\" The offer was readily accepted for\nthe fame of Muhammad [pbuh] had spread to Madinah and the strangers were\ncurious to see more of the man who had created a stir in the whole area. The\nProphet [pbuh] presented to them an expose of Islam, explained its implications, and\nthe responsibilities that fell upon the men who accepted it. When the Prophet [pbuh]\nconcluded his talk, they exchanged among themselves ideas to the following effect:\n\"Know surely, this is the Prophet with whom the Jews are ever threatening us;\nwherefore let us make haste and be the first to join him.\"\nThey, therefore, embraced Islam, and said to the Prophet, \"We have left our\ncommunity for no tribe is so divided by hatred and rancour as they are. Allâh may\ncement our ties through you. So let us go and invite them to this religion of yours;\nand if Allâh unites them in it, no man will be dearer than you.\"\nThe handful of Madinese converts remained steady to the cause and they preached\nthe Islam with full zeal and devotion with the result that they succeeded in winning\nadherents for Islam from amongst their fellow citizens and hardly was there a house\nin Madinah not talking curiously and enthusiastically about the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]. [Ibn Hisham 1/428- 430]\nMarriage of the Prophet [pbuh] to ‘Aishah [R]\nIn Shawwal of the same year, the Prophet [pbuh] concluded a marriage contract with\n‘Aishah [R], ‘the truth verifier’, when she was six of age and consummated his\nmarriage with her in Shawwal, the year 1 A.H. in Madinah when she was nine.\n[Bukhari 1/551; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl- al- Athar, p.10]\n\n-- 88 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n89\nAl-Isra’ and Al-Mi‘raj\n(The Miraculous Night Journey from Makkah to the Farthest Mosque in Jerusalem,\nand the Ascent through the Spheres of Heavens)\nThe last days of the Makkan phase of the Prophet’s life are noted for alternate\nfortunes ranging between two extremes: gradual success and continual persecution.\nHowever, glimpses of propitious lights were looming on the distant horizon, to\nultimately materialize in the event of the Prophet’s Night Journey to Jerusalem and\nthen Ascension through the spheres of the heavens.\nAs for its exact date, it is still controversial and no common consent has been\nreached. However, the majority of jurists is in favour of a date between 16- 12\nmonths prior to migration to Madinah. The following is a epitome of the details of\nthat miraculous event narrated on the authority of Ibn Al- Qayyim.[Za'd Al- Ma'ad\n2/49; Tareekh- e- Islam 1/124; Rahmat- al- lil'alameen 1/76]\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was carried in body from the Sacred Mosque in\nMakkah to the Distant Mosque in Jerusalem on a horse called Al- Buraq in the\ncompany of Gabriel, the archangel. There he alighted, tethered the horse to a ring in\nthe gate of the Mosque and led the Prophets in prayer. After that Gabriel took him to\nthe heavens on the same horse. When they reached the first heaven Gabriel asked\nthe guardian angel to open the door of heaven. It was opened and he saw Adam, the\nprogenitor of mankind. The Prophet [pbuh] saluted him and the other welcomed him\nand expressed his faith in Muhammad’s Prophethood. He saw the souls of martyrs on\nhis right and those of the wretched on his left.\nGabriel then ascended with the Prophet to the second heaven, asked for opening the\ngate and there he saw and saluted John, son of Zachariya (Yahya bin Zakariya) and\nJesus, son of Mary. They returned the salutation, welcomed him and expressed their\nfaith in his Prophethood. Then they reached the third heaven where they saw Joseph\n(Yusuf) and saluted him. The latter welcomed the Prophet and expressed faith in his\nProphethood. The Prophet, in the company of Gabriel, then reached the fourth\nheaven where he met the Prophet Enoch (Idris) and saluted him. Prophet Enoch\nreturned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Then he was carried\nto the fifth heaven where he met the Prophet Aaron (Harun) and saluted him. The\nlatter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. In the sixth\nheaven he met Moses (Musa) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and\nexpressed faith in his Prophethood. Muhammad [pbuh] on leaving, saw that Moses\nbegan to weep. He asked about the reason. Moses answered that he was weeping\nbecause he witnessed a man sent after him as a Messenger (Muhammad) who was\nable to lead more of his people to the Paradise than he himself did. Then Prophet\nMuhammad [pbuh] reached the seventh heaven and met Abraham (Ibrahim)[AWS]\nand saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his\nProphethood. Then he was carried to \tSidrat- al- Muntaha \t(the remotest lote tree) and\nwas shown \tAl- Bait- al- Ma‘mûr \t[(the much frequented house) which is like the Ka‘bah\n(Sacred House) encompassed daily by seventy thousand angels, so that the angels\nwho once encompassed it would not have their turn again till the Resurrection]. He\nwas then presented to the Divine Presence and experienced the thrill of witnessing\nthe Divine Glory and Manifestation at the closest possible propinquity. There the Lord\nrevealed unto His servant that which He revealed, and ordained fifty daily prayers for\nhim. On his return, he spoke to Moses that his followers had been enjoined to pray\n\n-- 89 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n90\nfifty times a day. Moses addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Your followers cannot\nperform so many prayers. Go back to your Lord and ask for a remission in number.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] turned to Gabriel as if holding counsel with him. Gabriel nodded,\n\"Yes, if you desire,\" and ascended with him to the Presence of Allâh. The All- Mighty\nAllâh, Glory is to Him, made a reduction of ten prayers. He then descended and\nreported that to Moses, who again urged him to request for a further reduction.\nMuhammad [pbuh] once more begged his Lord to reduce the number still further. He\nwent again and again in the Presence of Allâh at the suggestion of Moses for\nreduction in the number of prayers till these were reduced to five only. Moses again\nasked him to implore for more reduction, but he said: \"I feel ashamed now of\nrepeatedly asking my Lord for reduction. I accept and resign to His Will.\" When\nMuhammad [pbuh] went farther, a Caller was heard saying: \"I have imposed My\nOrdinance and alleviated the burden of My servants.\"\nThere is however some difference as regards the issue whether the Prophet saw\nAllâh with his physical eye or not. Some interpreters say that seeing Allâh with his\nnaked eyes was not confirmed. Ibn ‘Abbas, on the other hand, says that the word\nRu’ya \tas used in the Noble Qur’ân signifies the observation with the help of the eye.\nIn \tSûrah An–Najm \t(Chapter —The Star) we read:\n\"Then he approached and came closer.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 53:8]\nHere (he) refers to archangel Gabriel, and this context is completely different from\nthat in the Prophetic tradition of \tIsra’ \tand \tMi‘raj, where ‘the approach’ relates to that\nof the Lord, Glory is to Him.\nSome significant suggestive incidents featured the ‘Night Journey’ of the Prophet, of\nwhich we could mention:\n1. \tThe Prophet’s breast was cleft by Gabriel, his heart extracted and washed\nwith the water of Zamzam —a sacred spring in Makkah.\n2. \tIn the same context, there were brought to him two gold vessels. There was\nmilk in one, while the other was full of wine. He was asked to choose either of\nthem, so he selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel)\nsaid: \"You have been guided on \tAl- Fitrah \tor you have attained \tAl- Fitrah. Had\nyou selected wine, your nation would have been misled.\" [It is a symbolic way\nof saying that good and evil in the form of milk and wine were brought before\nthe Prophet and he instinctively made a choice for the good. It is very difficult\nto render the Arabic term ‘Fitrah’ \tinto English. It denotes the original\nconstitution or disposition, with which a child comes into this world, as\ncontrasted with qualities or inclinations acquired during life; besides it refers\nto the spiritual inclination inherent in man in his unspoilt state].\n3. \tThe Prophet [pbuh] told that he saw two manifest rivers, — the Nile and the\nEuphrates — and two hidden ones. It appears that the two manifest rivers,\nthe Nile and the Euphrates, symbolically describe the area in whose fertile\nvalleys, Muhammad’s Message will settle, and the people whereof will always\nremain the adherent bearers of Islam that will be passed on from generation\nto another. They can by no means suggest that they well up from the Garden.\n4. \tHe had the opportunity to see Malik, the guardian of Hell, with a cheerless\nfrowning face. Therein, he saw the Hell dwellers, of whom were those who\n\n-- 90 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n91\nunjustly eat up the property of the orphans. They have flews similar to those\nof camels, swallowing red- hot stones and then issuing out of their backs.\nThere were also the people who take usury with bellies too big to be able to\nmove around; they are trodden by the people of Pharaoh when these are\nadmitted into Hell. In the same abode, he saw the adulterers offered tasty\nfatty meat and rotten smelly one but they make option for the latter. The\nlicentious women were also there hanging from their breasts.\n5. \tThe ‘Night Journey’ raised a good deal of stir among the people and the\nsceptical audience plied Muhammad with all sorts of questions. He told them\nthat he saw the camels of Makkan merchants to and fro. He also guided them\nto some of their animals that went astray. He informed them that he had\ndrunk some of their water while they were fast asleep and left the container\ncovered.\nThe disbelievers, however, found it a suitable opportunity to jeer at the Muslims and\ntheir creed. They pestered the Prophet [pbuh] with questions as to the description of\nthe Mosque at Jerusalem, where he had never gone before and, to the astonishment\nof many, the Prophet’s replies furnished the most accurate information about that\ncity. He supplied them with all the news about their caravans and the routes of their\ncamels. However, all this increased in them nothing but flight from the Truth, and\nthey accepted nothing but disbelief.\nFor the true Muslims, however there was nothing unusual about the Night Journey.\nThe All- Mighty Allâh, Who is Powerful enough to have created the heavens and the\nearth by an act of His Will, is surely Powerful enough to take His Messenger beyond\nthe heavens and show him those signs of His at firsthand which are inaccessible to\nman otherwise. The disbelievers on their part went to see Abu Bakr on account of\nthis event, and he readily said: \"Yes, I do verify it.\" It was on this occasion that he\nearned the title of \tAs- Siddiq \t(the verifier of the truth). [Ibn Hisham 1/399]\nThe most eloquent and most concise justification of this ‘Journey’ is expressed in\nAllâh’s Words:\n\"... in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our \tAyât \t(proofs,\nevidences, signs, etc.)\" \t[Al- Qur'an 17:1].\nThe Divine rules as regards the Prophets goes as follows:\n\"Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that\nhe be one of those who have Faith with certainty.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 6:75]\nTo Moses, his Lord said:\n\"That We may show you (some) of Our Greater Signs.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 20:23]\nIn order that:\n\"He be of those who have Faith with certainty.\"\nThe Prophets, after seeing Allâh’s Signs, will establish their Faith on solid certainty\ntoo immune to be parted with. They are in fact eligible for this Divine privilege\n\n-- 91 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n92\nbecause they are the ones who will bear burdens too heavy for other ordinary people\nto carry, and in the process of their mission, they will regard all worldly ordeals and\nagonies too small to care about.\nThere are simple facts that emanate from this blessed Journey, and flow along into\nthe flowery garden of the Prophetic biography; peace and blessings of Allâh be upon\nits author, Muhammad. The story of ‘the Night Journey’ as we see in the Noble\nQur’ân is epitomised in the first verse of the \tSûrah \tIsra’(Chapter 17 — The Journey\nby Night) then there is a quick shift to uncover the shameful deeds and crimes of the\nJews, followed by an admonition saying that the Qur’ân guides to that which is most\njust and right. This arrangement is not in fact a mere coincidence. Jerusalem was the\nfirst scene of the Night Journey, and here lies the message directed to the Jews and\nwhich explicitly suggested that they would be discharged of the office of leadership\nof mankind due to the crimes they had perpetrated and which no longer justified\ntheir occupation of that office. The message suggested explicitly that the office of\nleadership would be reinstituted by the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to hold in his hand\nboth headquarters of the Abrahamic Faith, the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah and the\nFarthest Mosque in Jerusalem. It was high time for the spiritual authority to be\ntransferred from a nation whose history got pregnant with treachery, covenant-\nbreaching and aggression to another nation blessed with piety, and dutifulness to\nAllâh, with a Messenger who enjoys the privilege of the Qur’ânic Revelation, which\nleads to that which is best and right.\nThere, however, remains a crucial question waiting to be answered: How could this\nforeseen transition of authority be effected while the champion himself (Muhammad)\nwas left deserted and forsaken stumbling in the hillocks of Makkah? This question per\nse uncovered the secrets of another issue which referred to a phase of the Islamic\nCall and the appearance of another role it was about to take up, different in its\ncourse and noble in its approaches. The forerunners of that new task took the shape\nof Qur’ânic verses smacking of direct and unequivocal warning accompanied by a\nsevere ultimatum directed to the polytheists and their agents:\n\"And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a\ndefinite order (to obey Allâh and be righteous) to those among them [ or We\n(first) increase in number those of its population] who are given the good\nthings of this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of\ntorment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete\ndestruction. And how many generations (past nations) have We destroyed\nafter Noah! And Sufficient is your Lord as an All- Knower and All- Beholder of\nthe sins of His slaves.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 17:16, 17]\nTogether with these verses, there were others revealed to show the Muslims the\nrules and items of the civilization upon which they could erect their Muslim\ncommunity, and foreshadowing their ownership of a piece of land, exercising full\nfreedom over it and establishing a coherent society around whose axis the whole\nhumanity would rotate. Those verses in reality implied better prospects for the\nProphet [pbuh] comprising a secure shelter to settle in, and headquarters safe\nenough to empower and embolden him to communicate his Message to all the world\nat large; that was in fact the inner secret of that blessed journey. For this very\nwisdom and the like we deem it appropriate to suggest that ‘the Night Journey’ took\nplace either before the First Pledge of ‘Aqabah or between the two; after all, Allâh\nknows best.\n\n-- 92 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n93\nThe First ‘Aqabah Pledge\nWe have already spoken about six Madinese who embraced Islam in the pilgrimage\nseason in the eleventh year of Prophethood. They promised to communicate the\nMessage of Islam to their townsfolk.\nThe following year, on the occasion of the pilgrimage, there came a group of twelve\ndisciples ready to acknowledge Muhammad as their Prophet. The group of men\ncomprised five of the six who had met the Prophet [pbuh] the year before, the sixth\nwho stayed away was Jabir bin ‘Abdullah bin Reyab, the other seven were:\n1. \tMu‘adh bin Al- Harith, Ibn ‘Afra, from Khazraj.\n2. \tDhakwan bin ‘Abd Al- Qais, from Khazraj.\n3. \t‘Ubadah bin As- Samit, from Khazraj.\n4. \tYazeed bin Tha‘labah, from Khazraj.\n5. \t‘Al- ‘Abbas bin ‘Ubadah bin Nadalah, from Khazraj.\n6. \tAbul Haitham bin At- Taihan, from Aws.\n7. \t‘Uwaim bin Sa‘idah, from Aws.\nThey avowed their faith in Muhammad [pbuh] as a Prophet and swore: \"We will not\nworship any one but one Allah; we will not steal; neither will we commit adultery,\nnor kill our children; we will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood and we\nwill not disobey you in any just matter.\" When they had taken the pledge,\nMuhammad [pbuh] said: \"He who carries it out, Allâh will reward him; and who\nneglects anything and is afflicted in this world, it may prove redemption for him in\nthe Hereafter; and if the sin remains hidden from the eyes of the men and no grief\ncomes to him, then his affair is with Allâh. He may forgive him or He may not.\"\n[Bukhari 1/550; 2/727; 2/1003]\nThe Muslim Envoy in Madinah\nAfter the Pledge (in the form of an oath had been taken) the Prophet [pbuh] sent to\nYathrib (Madinah) Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al- ‘Abdari [R], the first Muslim ‘ambassador’ to\nteach the people there the doctrines of Islam, give them practical guidance and\nmake attempts at propagating the Islam among those who still professed\npolytheism. As‘ad bin Zurarah hosted him in Madinah. So prepared was the ground,\nand so zealous the propagation that the Islam spread rapidly from house to house\nand from tribe to tribe. There were various cheerful and promising aspects of success\nthat characterized Mus‘ab’s task. One day Mus‘ab and As‘ad were on their way to the\nhabitations of Bani ‘Abd Al- Ashhal and Bani Zafar, when they went into the premises\nof the latter clan. There they sat near a well conversing with some new converts.\nSa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Usaid bin Hudair, chiefs of the two clans heard of this meeting,\nso Usaid approached the Muslims armed with his lance while the other Sa‘d excused\nhimself on grounds that As‘ad was his maternal cousin. Usaid came closer cursing\nand swearing and accused the two men of befooling people weak of heart, and\nordered that they stop it altogether. Mus‘ab calmly invited him to sit saying, \"If you\nare pleased with our talk, you can accept it; should you hold it in abhorrence, you\ncould freely immunize yourself against what you hate.\" \"That’s fair,\" said Usaid,\npierced his lance in the sand, listened to Mus‘ab and then heard some verses of the\nNoble Qur’ân. His face bespoke satisfaction and pleasure before uttering any words\n\n-- 93 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n94\nof approval. He asked the two men about the procedures pertinent to embracing\nIslam. They asked him to observe washing, purge his garment, bear witness to the\nTruth and then perform two \tRak‘a. He responded and did exactly what he was asked\nto do, and then said there was a man (Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh) whose people would never\nhang back if he followed the Islam. He then left to see Sa‘d and his people. Sa‘d\ncould immediately understand that Usaid had changed. To a question posed by Sa‘d,\nUsaid said that two men were ready to comply with whatever orders they received.\nHe then managed a certain situation that provided the two men with a chance to talk\nwith Sa‘d privately. The previous scene with Usaid recurred and Sa‘d embraced\nIslam, and directly turned to his people swearing that he would never talk with them\nuntil they had believed in Allâh, and in His Messenger. Hardly did the evening of that\nday arrive when all the men and women of that sept of Arabians embraced Islam\nwith the exception of one, Al- Usairim, who hung back until the Day of Uhud. On that\nday he embraced Islam and fought the polytheists but was eventually killed before\nobserving any prostration in the way of prayer. The Prophet [pbuh] commented\nsaying: \"He has done a little but his reward is great.\"\nMus‘ab stayed in Madinah carrying out his mission diligently and successfully until all\nthe houses of \tAl- Ansar \t(the future Helpers) had Muslims elements, men and women.\nOne family only stood obdurate to the Islamic \tDa‘wah \t(Call). They were under the\ninfluence of the poet Qais bin Al- Aslat, who managed to hold them at bay and screen\noff the Call of Islam from their ears until the year 5 A.H.\nShortly before the approach of the following pilgrimage season, i.e. the thirteenth\nyear of Prophethood, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair returned to Makkah carrying to the Prophet\n[pbuh] glad tidings about the new fertile soil of Islam in Madinah, and its\nenvironment rich in the prospects of good, and the power and immunity that that\ncity was bound to provide to the cause of Islam. [Ibn Hisham 1/435; Za'd Al- Ma'ad\n2/51\n\n-- 94 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n95\nThe Second ‘Aqabah Pledge\nThe next year, thirteenth of Prophethood, June 622 A.D., during the pilgrimage\nseason, over seventy converts from Madinah came in the trail of their polytheist\npeople to perform the rituals of pilgrimage in Makkah. The oft- repeated question\namongst them was \"Isn’t it high time we protect Muhammad instead of leaving him\nforsaken, deserted and stumbling in the hillocks of Makkah?\"\nShortly after arrival, they conducted clandestine contacts with the Prophet [pbuh]\nand agreed to meet him secretly at night in mid \tTashreeq \tDays (the 11th, 12th and\n13th days of Dhul Hijja) in a hillock at Al- ‘Aqabah, the last year’s meeting place.\nOne of the leaders of the \tAnsâr \t(Helpers), Ka‘b bin Malik Al- Ansari, gave an account\nof the historic meeting which changed the whole course of the struggle between\nIslam and paganism, he said:\nWe set out for pilgrimage and struck a rendezvous in mid \tTashreeq \tDays. \tWe were\naccompanied by a celebrity and a notable of ours called ‘Abdullah bi",
  "n ‘Amr bin\nHaram, who was still a polytheist. We disclosed to him our intention of meeting\nMuhammad [pbuh] and exhorted him to join our ranks and give up polytheism lest\nhe should serve as wood for Hell in the Hereafter. He promptly embraced Islam and\nwitnessed the serious meeting at Al- ‘Aqabah.\nThat very night we slept with our people in our camps. After a third of the night had\nelapsed, we began to leave stealthily and met in a hillock nearby. We were seventy\nthree men and two women Nusaibah bint Ka‘b from the Najjars and Asma’ bint ‘Amr\nfrom Bani Salamah. We waited for the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] until he came in\nthe company of his uncle Al- ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib who (though himself not a\nMuslim), adjured us not to draw his nephew away from the protection of his own\nkindred unless we were fully prepared to defend him even at the risk of our lives. He\nwas the first to speak:\n\"O you people of the Khazraj — the Arabs used to call the \tAnsâr \t(Helpers)\nKhazraj, whether from Khazraj or Aws — you all know the position that\nMuhammad holds among us. We have protected him from our people as\nmuch as we could. He is honoured and respected among his people. He\nrefuses to join any party except you. So if you think you can carry out what\nyou promise while inviting him to your town, and if you can defend him\nagainst the enemies, then assume the burden that you have taken. But if\nyou are going to surrender him and betray him after having taken him away\nwith you, you had better leave him now because he is respected and well\ndefended in his own place.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 1/440- 442]\nKa‘b replied: \"We have heard your words, and now O Messenger of Allâh, it is for you\nto speak and take from us any pledge that you want regarding your Lord and\nyourself.\"\nIt was a definite stance showing full determination, courage and deep faith to\nshoulder the daunting responsibility and bear its serious consequences.\n\n-- 95 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n96\nThe Messenger of Allâh then preached the Faith, and the pledge was taken. Al- Imam\nAhmad, on the authority of Jabir, gave the following details:\nThe \tAnsâr \t(Helpers) asked the Messenger of Allâh about the principles over which\nthey would take a pledge. The Prophet answered:\n1. \tTo listen and obey in all sets of circumstances.\n2. \tTo spend in plenty as well as in scarcity.\n3. \tTo enjoin good and forbid evil.\n4. \tIn Allâh’s service, you will fear the censure of none.\n5. \tTo defend me in case I seek your help, and debar me from anything you\ndebar yourself, your spouses and children from. And if you observe those\nprecepts, Paradise is in store for you. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.155; Ibn\nHisham 1/454]\nIn another version narrated by Ka‘b, he said:\nThe Prophet [pbuh] began to speak, recited some Qur’ânic verses, called people unto\nAllâh, exhorted them to enter the fold of Islam and concluded saying: \"I give you my\npledge that you debar me from whatever you debar your women and children from.\"\nHere Al- Bara’ bin Ma‘rur, caught him by hand, and said: \"Oh yes, we swear by Allâh,\nWho sent you as a Prophet in Truth, that we will debar you from whatever we debar\nour women from. Have confidence in us, O Messenger of Allâh. By Allâh, we are\ngenuine fighters and quite reliable in war, it is a trait passed down to us from our\nancestors.\"\nThen ‘Abul Haitham At- Taihan interrupted and said: \"O Prophet of Allâh! Between us\nand the Jews, there are agreements which we would then sever. If Allâh grants you\npower and victory, should we expect that you would not leave us, and join the ranks\nof your people (meaning Quraish)?\" The Prophet [pbuh] smiled and replied:\n\"Nay, it would never be; your blood will be my blood. In life and death I will\nbe with you and you with me. I will fight whom you fight and I will make\npeace with those with whom you make peace.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 1/442]\nAfter the negotiations concerning the conditions of allegiance had ended, and all of\nthe audience were unanimously agreed to ratify it, two men of the early generation\nof converts who had embraced Islam in the eleventh and twelfth years rose to their\nfeet to apprise the others of the serious step they were about to take so that they\ncould give their pledge fully aware of the whole affair and consequently be ready for\nthe sacrifice they were expected to make. Al ‘Abbas bin Ubada bin Nadlah, in this\ncontext, remarked: \"O you people of Khazraj! Do you know the significance of the\npact that you are entering into with this man? You are in fact avowing that you will\nfight against all and sundry. If you fear that your property will be at stake or the\nlives of your nobles will be endangered, then leave him now, because if you do this\nafter the pledge, it will be degrading for you both in this world and the world to\ncome. But if you think that you can carry out what you are called upon to do in spite\nof the loss of precious lives and property, then undertake this heavy responsibility,\nand I swear by Allâh, that herein lies the good of this world and that of the next.\"\n\n-- 96 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n97\nThey replied, \"We have already considered the loss of property and the murder of\nour notables, yet we pay him allegiance. But what is our reward if we observe all the\nitems of this pact?\" The Prophet replied: \"Paradise is in store for you.\" Then they\nasked him to stretch out his hand, and they all stretched out their hands and took\nthe pledge. Only at that time did As‘ad bin Zurarah come to realize the people’s\nreadiness for sacrifice in the cause of Allâh. [Ibn Hisham 1/446]\nOn the authority of Jabir, who said: \"When we started to pay allegiance to the\nProphet [pbuh], As‘ad bin Zurarah stood up and gave the following short address:\n\"Take it easy people of Yathrib! We have not covered that long distance except\nbecause we have had deep belief that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is the Messenger of\nAllâh. We are already convinced that following him entails departure from the pagan\nArabs even if it were at the risk of our life. Should you preserve in this course,\nholdfast to it, and your great reward is placed in the Hand of Allâh, but if you are\ncaught in fear, I admonish you to give it up just now, and then you would be more\nexcusable by Allâh.\" [Musnad Ahmad]\nWith respect to the two women, the pledge was taken orally for the Prophet [pbuh]\nhad never shaken hands with a strange lady. [Muslim 2/131]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] then asked the group to appoint twelve deputies to preach Islam\nto their people in Madinah, to shoulder the responsibility of implementing the articles\nof this pledge and to guide the respective men of their own tribes in matters relating\nto the propagation of Islam. The deputies elected were nine from Al- Khazraj: As‘ad\nbin Zurarah bin ‘Ads, Sa‘d bin Ar- Rabi‘ bin ‘Amr, ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah bin\nTha‘labah, Rafi‘ bin Malik bin Al- ‘Ajlan, Al- Bara’ bin Ma‘rur bin Sakhr, ‘Abdullah bin\n‘Amr bin Haram, ‘Ubadah bin As- Samit bin Qais, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah bin Dulaim and Al-\nMundhir bin ‘Amr bin Khunais. Three others were from Al- Aws: Usaid bin Hudair bin\nSammak, Sa‘d bin Khaithamah bin Al- Harith and Rifa‘a bin ‘Abdul Mundhir bin\nZubair. Once again, those twelve men were sworn to act as surety over the affairs of\ntheir people just as the Christ’s disciples did, and the Prophet would act as surety\nover his people, meaning all the Muslims.\nSomehow or other, the news of these secret desert meetings with the Madinese\nleaked out. The Prophet immediately knew that it was a certain pudgy ugly devil,\ninhabited in Al- ‘Aqabah, who discovered their meeting, and he threatened to settle\nhis account with him as soon as possible.\nOn hearing this, Al- ‘Abbas bin Nadlah said \"By Allâh, Who has sent you in Truth, we\nare powerful enough to put the people of Mina (the Quraishites) to our swords\ntomorrow, if you desire.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said \"We have not been commanded to\nfollow that course. Now, back to your camps.\" They went back to sleep till morning.\n[Ibn Hisham 1/448]\nNo sooner did Quraish hear of this treaty than a kind of trouble- provoking tumult\nbegan to mushroom in all directions. They realized quite fully that an allegiance of\nthis sort is bound to produce far- reaching ramifications of direct impact on their lives\nand wealth. The following day, a large delegation comprising the leaders and arch-\ncriminals of Makkah set out for the camp of the Madinese to protest severely against\nthe treaty. They addressed the Madinese: \"O people of Khazraj, it transpired to us\nthat you have come here to conclude a treaty with this man (Muhammad) and\n\n-- 97 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n98\nevacuate him out of Makkah. By Allâh, we do really hold in abhorrence any sort of\nfight between you and us.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/448]\nThe Madinese polytheists having known nothing about the secretly taken pledge,\nbegan to swear by Allâh and answered in good faith that there was no truth in the\nreport. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, a Madinese polytheist, refuted their allegations\ndenouncing them as null and void, claiming that his people would never initiate\nanything unless he gave them clear orders.\nThe Madinese Muslims, however, remained silent neither negating nor confirming.\nThe Quraishite leaders seemed to be almost convinced by the arguments presented\nby the polytheists, and went back home frustrated. However, they did not fully\nacquiesce in the words they heard. They began to scrutinize the smallest details, and\ntrace the minutest news till it was established beyond a shadow of doubt that the\npact did take place, but that was after the Madinese pilgrims had left Makkah. In a fit\nof rage, they pursued the pilgrims but did not succeed in catching hold of anyone\nexcept Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. They subjected him to unspeakable tortures, but he was\nlater rescued by Al- Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Harith bin Harb bin Omaiya with whom he\nhad trade relations. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/51,52; Ibn Hisham 1/448- 450]\nThat is the story of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge, later known as the Great ‘Aqabah\nPledge, effected in an atmosphere of love, allegiance and mutual support between\nMadinese believers and weak Makkan Muslims. This new spirit of affection, rapport\nand cooperation could never be attributable to a fleeing whim, on the contrary, it\ntotally derived from an already deeply- established approach, viz. Belief in Allâh, His\nMessenger and His Book. It was a Belief so rooted in the selves that it managed to\nstand immune to all powers of injustice and aggression, and could be translated into\nmiracles in the practical aspects of action and ideology pursuit. That sort of Belief\nwas the real instrument for the Muslims to record in the annals of history\nunprecedented breakthroughs. We are also sure that the future will always remain\nwanting as regards those great achievements carried out by those great men.\n\n-- 98 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n99\nThe Vanguard of Migration\n(in the Cause of Allâh)\nAfter the endorsement of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge and the establishment of a\npetite Muslim state in a vast desert surging with disbelief and ignorance — the most\nserious gain in terms of Islam —, the Prophet [pbuh] gave his leave for the Muslims\nto migrate to Madinah, the nascent Muslim state.\nMigration to Madinah, in terms of personal interests, was no more than material\nwaste and sacrifice of wealth, all in return for personal safety only. Even here, the\nmigrant could not expect full security; he was liable to be robbed or even killed\neither at the beginning or end of his departure. The future was foggy, pregnant with\nvarious unpredictable sorts of sorrows and crises.\nBearing all this in mind, the Muslims began to migrate, while the polytheists spared\nno effort in hindering and debarring them, knowing beforehand that such a move\nimplied unimaginable threats and unthinkable destructive dangers to their whole\nsociety:\n1. \tThe first one to migrate was Abu Salamah, a year before the Great ‘Aqabah\nPledge. When he had made up his mind to leave Makkah, his in- laws, in a\ndesperate attempt to raise obstacles, detained his wife and snatched his son\nand dislocated his hand. Umm Salamah, after the departure of her husband\nand the loss of her son spent a year by herself weeping and lamenting. A\nrelative of hers eventually had pity on her and exhorted the others to release\nher son and let her join her husband. She then set out on a journey of 500\nkilometres with no help whatsoever. At a spot called At- Tan‘im, ‘Uthman bin\nTalhah came across her and offered to give her a ride to Madinah. She, along\nwith her son, joined Abu Salamah in the village of Quba’, a suburb of\nMadinah. [Ibn Hisham 1/468]\n2. \tAnother instance of the atrocities of the polytheist Makkans, as regards\nmigration, is Suhaib. This man expressed his wish to migrate and of course\nthis was a source of indignation to the disbelievers. They began to insult him\nclaiming that he had come into Makkah as a worthless tramp, but their town\nwas gracious enough and thanks to them he managed to make a lot of money\nand become wealthy. They gave orders that he would not leave. Seeing this,\nhe offered to give away all his wealth to them. They eventually agreed to\nrelease him on that condition. The Prophet heard this story and commented\non it saying:\n\"Suhaib is the winner, after all.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/477]\n3. \tThen, there was the story of ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, ‘Ayyash bin Abi Rabi‘a and\nHisham bin Al- ‘Asi, who agreed to meet at a certain place one morning in\norder to leave for Madinah; ‘Umar and ‘Ayyash came but Hisham was\ndetained by the Makkans.\nShortly afterwards Abu Jahl, and his brother Al- Harith came to Madinah to see their\nthird brother ‘Ayyash. They cunningly tried to touch the most sensitive area in man,\ni.e. his relation with his mother. They addressed him claiming that his mother had\n\n-- 99 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n100\nsworn she would never comb her hair, nor shade herself off the sun unless she had\nseen him. ‘Ayyash took pity on his mother, but ‘Umar was intelligent enough to\nunderstand that they wanted to entice ‘Ayyash away from Islam so he cautioned him\nagainst their tricks, and added \"your mother would comb her hair if lice pestered\nher, and would shade herself off if the sun of Makkah got too hot for her.\" These\nwords notwithstanding, ‘Ayyash was determined to go and see his mother, so ‘Umar\ngave him his manageable docile camel advising him to stick to its back because it\nwould provide rescue for him if he perceived anything suspicious on their part. The\nparty of three then set forth towards Makkah. As soon as they covered part of the\ndistance, Abu Jahl complained about his camel and requested ‘Ayyash to allow him to\nride behind him on his camel. When they knelt down to the level of the ground, the\ntwo polytheists fell upon ‘Ayyash and tied him. They rode on into Makkah shouting at\npeople to follow their example with respect to ‘fools’. [Ibn Hisham 1/474; Bukhari\n1/558]\nThese are just three self- explanatory models of the Makkans’ reaction towards\nanyone intending to migrate. Nevertheless, the believers still managed to escape in\nsuccessive groups and so rapidly that within two months of the Second ‘Aqabah\nPledge, entire quarters of Makkah were deserted. Almost all the followers of\nMuhammad had migrated to their new abode, except Abu Bakr, ‘Ali, the Prophet\n[pbuh] himself, and those helpless noble souls who had been detained in\nconfinement or were unable to escape. The Prophet [pbuh], together with Abu Bakr\nand ‘Ali, had made all the necessary preparations for migration but was waiting for\nleave from his Lord. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/52]\nIt is noteworthy that most of the Muslims who had migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia),\ncame back to Madinah to join the rest of the Muslims there.\nThe situation was no doubt critical in Makkah but Muhammad [pbuh] was not at all\nperturbed. Abu Bakr was, however, urging the Prophet to depart from that town. He\nwas also eagerly waiting for an opportunity to accompany Muhammad [pbuh] on this\neventful journey. But the Prophet told him that the time had not yet come; the Lord\nhad not given him the command to migrate. In anticipation of the Command of Allâh,\nAbu Bakr had made preparations for the journey. He had purchased two swift camels\nand had fed them properly for four months so that they could successively stand the\nordeals of the long desert journey. [Bukhari 1/553]\n\n-- 100 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n101\nIn An-Nadwah (Council) House\nThe Parliament of Quraish\nThe polytheists were paralysed by the carefully planned and speedy movement of\nMuhammad’s followers towards their new abode in Madinah. They were caught in\nunprecedented anxiety and got deeply worried over their whole pagan and economic\nentity. They already experienced Muhammad [pbuh] as an influential leader; and his\nfollowers as determined, decent and always ready to sacrifice all they had for the\nsake of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Al- Aws and Al- Khazraj tribes, the would- be-\nhosts of the Makkan Muslims, were also known in Arabia for their might and power in\nwar, and judicious and sensible approach in peace. They were also averse to rancour\nand prejudice for they themselves had had bitter days of inter- tribal warfare.\nMadinah , itself, the prospective headquarters of the ever- growing Islamic Call,\nenjoyed the most serious strategic position. It commanded the commercial routes\nleading to Makkah whose people used to deal in about a quarter of a million gold\ndinar- worth commodities every year. Security of the caravan routes was crucial for\nthe perpetuity of prosperous economic life. All those factors borne in mind, the\npolytheists felt they were in the grip of a serious threat. They, therefore, began to\nseek the most effective method that could avert this imminent danger. They\nconvened a meeting on Thursday, 26th Safar, the year fourteen of Prophethood /\n12th September 622 A.D[For details see Rahmat- al- lil'alameen 1/95- 102] ., i.e. two\nand a half months after the Great ‘Aqabah Pledge. On that day, \"the Parliament of\nMakkah\" held the most serious meeting ever, with one item on the agenda: How to\ntake effective measures with a view to stopping that tidal wave. Delegates\nrepresenting all the Quraishite tribes attended the meeting, the most significant of\nwhom were:\n1. \tAbu Jahl bin Hisham, from Bani Makhzum;\n2. \tJubair bin Mut‘im, Tuaima bin ‘Adi, and Al- Harith bin ‘Amir representing Bani\nNaufal bin ‘Abd Munaf;\n3. \tRabi‘a’s two sons Shaibah and ‘Utbah besides Abu Sufyan bin Harb from Bani\n‘Abd Shams bin ‘Abd Munaf;\n4. \tAn- Nadr bin Al- Harith (who had besmeared the Prophet [pbuh] with animal\nentrails) to speak for Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar;\n5. \tAbul Bukhtary bin Hisham, Zama‘a bin Al- Aswad and Hakeem bin Hizam to\nrepresent Bani Asad bin ‘Abd Al- ‘Uzza;\n6. \tAl- Hajjaj’s two sons Nabih and Munbih from Bani Sahm;\n7. \tOmaiyah bin Khalaf from Bani Jumah.\nOn their way to An- Nadwah House, \tIblis \t(Satan) in the guise of a venerable elderly\nman standing at the door interrupted their talk and introduced himself as a man\nfrom Najd curious enough to attend the meeting, listen to the debate and wish them\nsuccess to reach a sound opinion. He was readily admitted in.\nThere was a lengthy debate and several proposals were put forward. Expulsion from\nMakkah was proposed and debated in turn but finally turned down on grounds that\nhis sweet and heart- touching words could entice the other Arabs to attack them in\ntheir own city. Imprisonment for life was also debated but also refused for fear that\nhis followers might increase in number, overpower them and release him by force. At\nthis point, the arch- criminal of Makkah, Abu Jahl bin Hisham suggested that they\n\n-- 101 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n102\nassassinate him. But assassination by one man would have exposed him and his\nfamily to the vengeance of blood. The difficulty was at last solved by Abu Jahl\nhimself, who suggested that a band of young men, one from each tribe, should strike\nMuhammad simultaneously with their swords so that the blood- money would be\nspread over them all and therefore could not be exacted, and his people would seek\na mind- based recourse for settlement. The sinful proposal was unanimously\naccepted, and the representatives broke up the meeting and went back home with\nfull determination for immediate implementation. \t[Ibn Hisham 1/480-482]\n\n-- 102 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n103\nMigration of the Prophet [pbuh]\nWhen the iniquitous decision had been made, Gabriel was sent down to Muhammad\n[pbuh] to reveal to him Quraish’s plot and give him his Lord’s Permission to leave\nMakkah. He fixed to him the time of migration and asked him not to sleep that night\nin his usual bed. At noon, the Prophet [pbuh] went to see his Companion Abu Bakr\nand arranged with him everything for the intended migration. Abu Bakr was\nsurprised to see the Prophet [pbuh] masked coming to visit him at that unusual\ntime, but he soon learned that Allâh’s Command had arrived, and he proposed that\nthey should migrate together, to which the Prophet [pbuh] gave his consent. [Bukhari\n1/553]\nTo make the necessary preparations for the implementation of their devilish plan, the\nchiefs of Makkah had chosen eleven men: Abu Jahl, Hakam bin Abil Al- ‘As, ‘Uqbah\nbin Abi Mu‘ait, An- Nadr bin Harith, Omaiyah bin Khalaf, Zama‘a bin Al- Aswad,\nTu‘aima bin ‘Adi, Abu Lahab, Ubai bin Khalaf, Nabih bin Al- Hajjaj and his brother\nMunbih bin Al- Hajjaj. All were on the alert. As night advanced, they posted assassins\naround the Prophet’s house. Thus they kept vigil all night long, waiting to kill him the\nmoment he left his house early in the morning, peeping now and then through a hole\nin the door to make sure that he was still lying in his bed. Abu Jahl, the great enemy\nof Islam, used to walk about haughtily and arrogantly jeering at Muhammad’s words,\nsaying to the people around him: \"Muhammad claims that if you follow him, he will\nappoint you rulers over the Arabs and non- Arabs and in the Hereafter your reward\nwill be Gardens similar to those in Jordan, otherwise, he will slaughter you and after\ndeath you will be burnt in fire.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/483] \tHe was too confident of the success of\nhis devilish plan. Allâh, the All- Mighty, however, in Whose Hands lie the sovereignty\nof the heavens and earth, does what He desires; He renders succour and can never\nbe overpowered. He did exactly what He later said to His Prophet:\n\"And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad\n[pbuh]) to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out (from your home,\ni.e. Makkah); they were plotting and Allâh too was planning, and Allâh is the\nBest of the planners.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:30]\nAt that critical time the plans of Quraish utterly failed despite the tight siege they laid\nto the Prophet’s house, the Prophet [pbuh] and ‘Ali were inside the house. The\nProphet [pbuh] told ‘Ali to sleep in his bed and cover himself with his green mantle\nand assured him full security under Allâh’s protection and told him that no harm\nwould come to him. The Prophet [pbuh] then came out of the room and cast a\nhandful of dust at the assassins and managed to work his way through them reciting\nverses of the Noble Qur’ân:\n\"And We have put a barrier before them, and a barrier behind them, and We\nhave covered them up, so that they cannot see.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 36:9]\nHe proceeded direct to the house of Abu Bakr who, immediately accompanied him\nand both set out southwards, clambered up the lofty peak of Mountain Thawr, and\ndecided to take refuge in a cave. [Ibn Hisham 1/483; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/52]\nThe assassins who laid siege to the house were waiting for the zero hour when\nsomeone came and informed them that the Prophet [pbuh] had already left. They\nrushed in and to their utter surprise, found that the person lying in the Prophet’s bed\n\n-- 103 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n104\nwas ‘Ali not Muhammad [pbuh]. This created a stir in the whole town. The Prophet\n[pbuh] had thus left his house on Safar 27th, the fourteenth year of Prophethood,\ni.e. 12/13 September 622 A.D. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/95]\nKnowing already that Quraish would mobilize all its potentials to find him, he played\na clever trick on them and instead of taking the road to Madinah in north side of\nMakkah as the polythiest would expect, he walked along a road least expected lying\nsouth of Makkah and leading to Yemen. He walked for 5 miles until he reached a\nrough rocky mountain called Thawr. There his shoes were worn out, some said he\nused to walk tiptoe in order not to leave a trail behind him. Abu Bakr [R] carried him\nup the mountain to a cave called after the name of the mountain, Cave Thawr. Abu\nBakr first entered to explore the cave and be sure that it was safe, closed all holes\nwith pieces torn off from his clothes, cleaned it and then asked the Prophet [pbuh] to\nstep in. The Prophet [pbuh] went in and immediately laid his head in Abu Bakr’s lap\nand fell asleep. Suddenly Abu Bakr’s foot was stung by a poisonous insect. It hurt so\nmuch that his tears fell on the Prophet’s face. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately\napplied his saliva on Abu Bakr’s foot and the pain went off on the spot. They confined\nthemselves to this cave for three nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. ‘Abdullah, the\nson of Abu Bakr would go to see them after dusk, stay the night there, apprise them\nof the latest situation in Makkah, and then leave in the early morning to mix with the\nMakkans as usual and not to draw the least attention to his clandestine activities.\n‘Amir bin Fuhairah, while in the company of other shepherds of Makkah tending his\nmaster Abu Bakr’s flock, used to stole away unobserved every evening with a few\ngoats to the cave and furnished its inmates with a plentiful supply of milk. \t[Bukhari 1/553;\nIbn Hisham 1/486]\nQuraish, on the other hand, were quite baffled and exasperated when the news of\nthe escape of the two companions was confirmed. They brought ‘Ali to Al- Ka‘bah,\nbeat him brutally and confined him there for an hour attempting desperately to make\nhim divulge the secret of the disappearance of the two ‘fugitives’, but to no avail.\nThey then went to see Asma’, Abu Bakr’s daughter, but here also their attempts\nwent in vain. While at her door Abu Jahl slapped the girl so severely that her earring\nbroke up.[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/96; Ibn Hisham 1/487]\nThe notables of Makkah convened an emergency session to determine the future\ncourse of action and explore all areas that could help arrest the two men. They\ndecided to block all avenues leading out of Makkah and imposed heavy armed\nsurveillance over all potential exits. A price of 100 camels was set upon the head of\neach one. [Bukhari 1/554] \tHorsemen, infantry and tracers of tracks scoured the country.\nOnce they even reached the mouth of the cave where the Prophet [pbuh] and Abu\nBakr were hiding. When he saw the enemy at a very close distance, Abu Bakr\nwhispered to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"What, if they were to look through the crevice and\ndetect us?\" The Prophet [pbuh] in his God- inspired calm replied:\n\"Silence Abu Bakr! What do you think of those two with whom the Third is\nAllâh.\"[Bukhari 1/516; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.168]\nIt was really a Divine miracle, the chasers were only a few steps from the cave.\nFor three days Muhammad [pbuh] and Abu Bakr lived in the cave and Quraish\ncontinued their frantic efforts to get hold of them.\n\n-- 104 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n105\nSomeone called ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit, who had as yet not embraced Islam, but was\ntrusted by Abu Bakr, and had been hired by him as a guide, reached the cave after\nthree nights according to a plan bringing with him Abu Bakr’s two camels. His report\nsatisfied the noble ‘fugitives’ that the search had slackened. The opportunity to\ndepart was come. Here Abu Bakr offered the Prophet [pbuh] the swift animal to ride\non. The latter agreed provided that he would pay its price. They took with them the\nfood provisions that Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, brought and tied in a bundle of\nher waistband, after tearing it into two parts, hence the appellation attached to her:\n\"Asma’ of the two waistbands.\" The Prophet [pbuh], Abu Bakr and ‘Amir bin Fuhairah\ndeparted, and their guide ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit led them on hardly ever trodden\nways along the coastal route. That was in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, 1st year A.H., i.e.\nSeptember 622 A.D. The little caravan travelled through many villages on their way\nto Quba’. In this context, it is relevant to introduce some interesting incidents that\nfeatured their wearying journey:\n1. \tOne day they could find no shelter from the scorching heat so Abu Bakr [R]\ncast a glance and found a little shade beside a rock. He cleaned the ground,\nspread his mantle for the Prophet [pbuh] to lie on and himself went off in\nsearch of food. He came across a shepherd, a bedouin boy, who was also\nseeking a shelter. Abu Bakr asked him for some milk and took it to the\nProphet [pbuh], cooled it with some water and waited till the Prophet [pbuh]\nwoke up and quenched his thirst. [Bukhari 1/510]\n2. \tWhoever asked Abu Bakr [R] about the identity of his honourable companion,\nhe would reply that he was a man who guided him on his way. The questioner\nwould think that Muhammad [pbuh] was a guide, in terms of roads, whereas\nAbu Bakr used to mean guide to the way of righteousness. [Bukhari 1/556]\n3. \tQuraish, as we have already mentioned, had declared that whoever would\nseize Muhammad [pbuh] would receive a hundred camels as reward. This had\nspurred many persons to try their luck. Among those who were on the\nlookout for the Prophet [pbuh] and his companion in order to win the reward\nwas Suraqah, the son of Malik. He, on receiving information that a party of\nfour, had been spotted on a certain route, decided to pursue it secretly so\nthat he alone should be the winner of the reward. He mounted a swift horse\nand went in hot pursuit of them. On the way the horse stumbled and he fell\non the ground. On drawing a lot so as to divine whether he should continue\nthe chase or not, as the Arabs used to do in such circumstances, he found the\nomens unpropitious. But the lust for material wealth blinded him al",
  "together\nand he resumed the chase. Once more he met with the same fate but paid no\nheed to it. Again he jumped onto the saddle and galloped at a break- neck\nspeed till he came quite close to the Prophet [pbuh]. Abu Bakr’s heart\nagitated and he kept looking back while the Prophet [pbuh] remained\nsteadfast and continued reciting verses of the Qur’ân.\nThe repeated stumbling of Suraqah’s horse and his falling off awakened him\nto the situation, and he realized that it was a constant warning of Allâh for his\nevil design which he contemplated against the Prophet [pbuh]. He approached\nthe travelling group with a penitent heart and begged of the Prophet [pbuh]\nforgiveness in all humility. He addressed the Prophet [pbuh] and his\ncompanion, saying: \"Your people (the Quraishites) have promised a generous\nreward to anyone who captures you.\" He added that he offered them\nprovision but they declined his offer. They only asked him to screen off their\ndeparture and blind the polytheists to their hiding place. Then the Prophet\n\n-- 105 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n106\n[pbuh] forgave him and confirmed it with a token written by ‘Amir bin\nFuhairah on a piece of parchment. Suraqah hurried back to Makkah and tried\nto foil the attempts of those who were in pursuit of Muhammad [pbuh] and\nhis noble companions. The sworn enemy was converted into an honest\nbeliever. [Bukhari 1/516, 1/554; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/53]\nIn a version by Abu Bakr [R], he said: \"We emigrated while the Makkans were\nin pursuit of us. None caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju‘sham\non a horse. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, this one has caught up with us.’ The\nProphet [pbuh] replied:\n‘Don’t be cast down, verily, Allâh is with us.’\"\n4. \tThe party continued its journey until it reached to solitary tents belonging to a\nwoman called Umm Ma‘bad Al- Khuza‘iyah. She was a gracious lady who sat at\nher tent- door with a mat spread out for any chance traveller that might pass\nby the way. Fatigued and thirsty, the Prophet [pbuh] and his companions\nwanted to refresh themselves with food and some milk. The lady told them\nthat the flock was out in the pasture and the goat standing nearby was almost\ndry. It was a rainless year. The Prophet [pbuh], with her permission, touched\nits udders, reciting over them the Name of Allâh, and to their great joy, there\nflowed plenty of milk out of them. The Prophet [pbuh] first offered that to the\nlady of the house, and he shared what was left with the members of the\nparty. Before he left, he milked the goat, filled the container and gave it to\nUmm Ma‘bad. Later on, her husband arrived with slender goats hardly having\nany milk in their udders. He was astonished to see milk in the house. His wife\ntold him that a blessed man passed by the way, and then she gave details\nabout his physical appearance and manner of talk. Here Abu Ma‘bad realized\non the spot that the man was the one whom Quraish were searching for and\nasked her to give full description of him. She gave a wonderful account of his\nphysique and manners, to which we will go in detail later in the process of\ntalking about his attributes and merits.\nAbu Ma‘bad, after listening to his wife’s account, expressed a sincere wish to\naccompany the Prophet [pbuh] whenever that was possible, and reiterated his\nadmiration in verses of poetry that echoed all over Makkah to such an extent\nthat the people therein thought it was a jinn inculcating words in their ears.\nAsma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, on hearing those lines, got to know that the\ntwo companions were heading for Madinah . [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/54] \tThe short poem\nopened with thanks giving to Allâh having given them (the Ma‘bads) the\nchance to host the Prophet [pbuh] for a while. It then gave an account of the\nbliss that would settle in the heart of the Prophet’s companion whosoever he\nwas; it closed with an invitation to all mankind to come and see by\nthemselves Umm Ma‘bad, her goat and the container of milk that would all\ntestify to the truthfulness of the Prophet [pbuh] .\n5. \tOn his way to Madinah , the Prophet [pbuh] met Abu Buraidah, one of those\ndriven by their lust for the reward of Quraish. No sooner did he face the\nProphet [pbuh] and talk with him, than he embraced Islam along with\n\n-- 106 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n107\nseventy of his men. He took off his turban, tied it round his lance and took it\nas a banner bearing witness that the angel of security and peace had come to\nimbue the whole world with justice and fairness. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/101]\n6. \tThe two Emigrants resumed their journey. It was during this time that they\nmet Az- Zubair at the head of a caravan returning from Syria. There was\nwarm greeting and Az- Zubair presented to them two white garments which\nthey thankfully accepted. [Bukhari 1/554]\nOn Monday, 8th Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, i.e. September\n23rd. 622, the Messenger of Allâh arrived at Quba’. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/102]\nAs soon as the news of Muhammad’s arrival began to spread, crowds came flocking\nout of Madinah . They would come every morning and wait eagerly for his\nappearance until forced by the unbearable heat of the midday sun to return. One day\nthey had gone as usual, and after a long wait and watch they retired to the city when\na Jew, catching a glimpse of three travellers clad in white winding their way to\nMadinah , shouted from the top of a hillock: \"O you people of Arabia! Your\ngrandfather has come! He, whom you have been eagerly waiting for, has come!\" The\nMuslims immediately rushed holding their weapons, (to defend him)[Bukhari 1/555]\n. The joyful news soon spread through the city and people marched forward to greet\ntheir noble guest.\nIbn Al- Qayyim said: \"The shouts of ‘Allâhu Akbar’ (Allâh is Great) resounded in Banu\n‘Amr bin ‘Auf. Muhammad’s [pbuh] elation correspondingly increased, but with rare\nsense of timing and propriety, called a halt. Serenity enveloped him and the\nñevelation was sent down:[Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/54]\n\"... then verily, Allâh is his Maula (Lord, Master or Protector), and Gabriel,\nand the righteous among the believers, - and furthermore, the angels - are\nhis helpers.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 66:4] [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/54; Ibn Hisham 1/493]\n‘Urwah bin Az- Zubair said: They received the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] , and went\nwith them to the right. There Banu ‘Amr bin ‘Awf hosted him. That was on Monday,\nRabi‘ Al- Awwal. He sat down silent, and \tAl- Ansar \t(the Helpers), who had not had the\nopportunity to see him before, came in to greet him: It is said that the sun became\ntoo hot so Abu Bakr stood up to shade him from the hot sun rays. \t[Bukhari 1/555] \tIt was\nreally an unprecedented day in Madinah . The Jews could perceive concretely the\nveracity of their Prophet Habquq, who said: ‘God has come from At- Taiman, and the\nQudus one from Faran Mount.’\nMuhammad [pbuh] stayed in Quba’ with Kulthum bin Al- Hadm, a hospitable chief of\nthe tribe of ‘Amr bin ‘Awf. Here he spent four days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\nand Thursday . It was during this period that the foundation of Quba’ Mosque was\nlaid on the basis of pure piety. ‘Ali hung back in Makkah for three days to return the\ntrusts, on behalf of the Prophet [pbuh], to their respective owners. After that he\nstarted his emigration journey to catch up with him at Quba’. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/54; Ibn Hisham\n1/493]\nOn Friday morning, the Prophet [pbuh], sent for Bani An- Najjar, his maternal uncles,\nto come and escort him and Abu Bakr to Madinah . He rode towards the new\nheadquarters amidst the cordial greetings of his Madinese followers who had lined\nhis path. He halted at a place in the vale of Banu Salim and there he performed his\n\n-- 107 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n108\nFriday prayer with a hundred others [Bukhari 1/555] . Meanwhile the tribes and\nfamilies of Madinah , the new name for Yathrib and a short form of ‘The Messenger’s\nMadinah \t(City)’, came streaming forth, and vied with one another in inviting the\nnoble visitor to their homes. The girls of the Madinese used to chant beautiful verses\nof welcome rich in all meanings of obedience and dutifulness to the new Messenger.\nThough not wealthy, every \tAnsar \t(Helper) was wholeheartedly eager and anxious to\nreceive the Messenger in his house. It was indeed a triumphal procession. Around\nthe camel of Muhammad [pbuh] and his immediate followers, rode the chiefs of the\ncity in their best raiment and in glittering armour, everyone saying: \"Alight here O\nMessenger of Allâh, abide by us.\" Muhammad [pbuh] used to answer everyone\ncourteously and kindly: \"This camel is commanded by Allâh, wherever it stops, that\nwill be my abode.\"\nThe camel moved onward with slackened rein, reached the site of the Prophetic\nMosque and knelt down. He did not dismount until it rose up again, went on forward,\nturned back and then returned to kneel down in the very former spot. Here, he\nalighted in a quarter inhabited by Banu Najjar, a tribe related to the Prophet [pbuh]\nfrom the maternal side. In fact, it was his wish to honour his maternal uncles and\nlive among them. The fortunate host, Abu Ayyub Al- Ansari, stepped forward with\nunbounded joy for the Divine blessing appropriated to him, welcomed the Noble\nGuest and solicited him to enter his house. \t[Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/55]\nA few days later, there arrived the Prophet’s spouse Sawdah, his two daughters\nFatimah and Umm Kulthum, Usama bin Zaid, Umm Aiman, ‘Abdullah — son of Abu\nBakr with Abu Bakr’s house- hold including ‘Aishah [R]Ç. Zainab was not able to\nemigrate and stayed with her husband Abi Al- ‘As till Badr Battle. \t[Bukhari 1/556]\n‘Aishah [R]Ç said: \"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] arrived in Madinah , both\nAbu Bakr and Bilal fell ill. I used to attend to their needs. When the fever took firm\ngrip of Abu Bakr he used to recite verses of poetry that smacked of near death; Bilal,\nwhen the fit of fever alleviated, would also recite verses of poetry that pointed to\nclear homesickness.\" ‘Aishah [R]Ç added:\n\"I briefed the Prophet [pbuh] on their grave situation, and he replied: O Allâh, we\nentreat You to establish in our hearts a strong love for Madinah equal to that we\nused to have for Makkah, or even more. O Allâh, bless and increase the wealth of\nMadinah and we beseech You to transmute its rotten mud into wholesome edible\nfat.\" \t[Bukhari 1/588]\n\n-- 108 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n109\nLife in Madinah\nThe Madinese era could be divided into three phases:\n1. \tThe first phase was characterized by too much trouble and discord, and too\nmany obstacles from within coupled by a hostile wave from without aiming at\ntotal extermination of the rising faith. It ended with Al- Hudaibiyah Peace\nTreaty in Dhul Qa‘da 6 A.H.\n2. \tThe second phase featured a truce with the pagan leadership and ended in\nthe conquest of Makkah in Ramadan 8 A.H. It also witnessed the Prophet\n[pbuh] inviting kings beyond Arabia to enter the fold of Islam.\n3. \tIn the third phase, people came to embrace Islam in hosts. Tribes and other\nfolks arrived in Madinah to pay homage to the Prophet [pbuh]. It ended at the\ndeath of the Prophet [pbuh] in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal 11 A.H.\nThe First Phase: The Status Quo in Madinah at the Time of Emigration\nEmigration to Madinah could never be attributable to attempts to escape from jeers\nand oppression only, but it also constituted a sort of cooperation with the aim of\nerecting the pillars of a new society in a secure place. Hence it was incumbent upon\nevery capable Muslim to contribute to building this new homeland, immunizing it and\nholding up its prop. As a leader and spiritual guide, there was no doubt the Noble\nMessenger [pbuh], in whose hands exclusively all affairs would be resolved.\nIn Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] had to deal with three distinctively different\ncategories of people with different respective problems:\n1. \tHis Companions, the noble and Allâh fearing elite [R]\n2. \tPolytheists still detached from the Islam and were purely\nMadinese tribes.\n3. \tThe Jews.\n1. \tAs for his Companions, the conditions of life in Madinah were totally different\nfrom those they experienced in Makkah. There, in Makkah, they used to strive\nfor one corporate target, but physically, they were scattered, overpowered\nand forsaken. They were helpless in terms of pursuing their new course of\norientation. Their means, socially and materially, fell short of establishing a\nnew Muslim community. In parallel lines, the Makkan Chapters of the Noble\nQur’ân were confined to delineating the Islamic precepts, enacting legislations\npertaining to the believers individually and enjoining good and piety and\nforbidding evils and vices.\nIn Madinah , things were otherwise; here all the affairs of their life rested in\ntheir hands. Now, they were at ease and could quite confidently handle the\nchallenges of civilization, construction, means of living, economics, politics,\ngovernment administration, war and peace, codification of the questions of\nthe allowed and prohibited, worship, ethics and all the relevant issues. In a\nnutshell, they were in Madinah at full liberty to erect the pillars of a new\nMuslim community not only utterly different from that pre- Islamic code of life,\nbut also distinctive in its features in the world at large. It was a society that\n\n-- 109 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n110\ncould stand for the Islamic Call for whose sake the Muslims had been put to\nunspeakable tortures for 10 years. No doubt, the construction of a society\nthat runs in line with this type of ethics cannot be accomplished overnight,\nwithin a month or a year. It requires a long time to build during which\nlegislation and legalization will run gradually in a complementary process with\nmind cultivation, training and education. Allâh, the All- Knowing, of course\nundertook legislation and His Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], implementation\nand orientation:\n\"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger\n(Muhammad [pbuh]) from among themselves, reciting to them His\nVerses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism),\nand teaching them the Book (this Qur’ân, Islamic laws and Islamic\nJurisprudence) and \tAl- Hikmah \t(As- Sunna: legal ways, orders, acts of\nworship, etc. of the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh].).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 62:2]\nThe Prophet’s Companions [R] , rushed enthusiastically to assimilate these\nQur’ânic rules and fill their hearts joyfully with them:\n\"And when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e.\nthe Verses) increase their Faith.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:2]\nWith respect to the Muslims, this task constituted the greatest challenge for\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. In fact, this very purpose lay at the heart of\nthe Islamic Call and the Muhammadan mission; it was never an incidental\nissue though there were the matters that required urgent addressing.\nThe Muslims in Madinah consisted virtually of two parties: The first one\nalready settled down in their abode, land and wealth, fully at ease, but seeds\nof discord amongst them were deeply seated and chronic enmity continually\nevoked; they were \tAl- Ansar \t(the Helpers). The second party were \tAl-\nMuhajirun \t(the Emigrants), homeless, jobless and penniless. Their number\nwas not small, on the contrary, it was increasing day by day after the Prophet\n[pbuh] had given them the green light to leave for Madinah whose economic\nstructure, originally not that prosperous one, began to show signs of\nimbalance aggravated by the economic boycott that the anti- Islamic groups\nimposed and consequently imports diminished and living conditions worsened.\n2. \tThe purely Madinese polytheists constituted the second sector with whom the\nProphet [pbuh] had to deal. Those people had no control at all over the\nMuslim. Some of them nursed no grudge against the Muslims, but were rather\nskeptical of their ancestors’ religious practices, and developed tentative\ninclination towards Islam and before long they embraced the new faith and\nwere truly devoted to Allâh. However, some others harboured evil intentions\nagainst the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers but were too cowardly to resist\nthem publicly, they were rather, under those Islamically favourable\nconditions, obliged to fake amicability and friendliness. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai,\nwho had almost been given presidency over Al- Khazraj and Al- Aws tribes in\nthe wake of Bu‘ath War between the two tribes, came at the head of that\ngroup of hypocrites. The Prophet’s advent and the vigorous rise of the new\nspirit of Islam foiled that orientation and the idea soon went into oblivion. He,\nseeing another one, Muhammad [pbuh], coming to deprive him and his\n\n-- 110 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n111\nagents of the prospective temporal privileges, could not be pleased, and for\noverriding reasons he showed pretension to Islam but with horrible disbelief\ndeeply- rooted in his heart. He also used to exploit some events and weak-\nhearted new converts in scheming malevolently against the true believers.\n3. \tThe Jews (the Hebrews), who had migrated to Al- Hijaz from Syria following\nthe Byzantine and Assyrian persecution campaigns, were the third category\nexistent on the demographic scene in Madinah. In their new abode they\nassumed the Arabian stamp in dress, language and manner of life and there\nwere instances of intermarriage with the local Arabs, however they retained\ntheir ethnic particularism and detached themselves from amalgamation with\nthe immediate environment. They even used to pride in their Jewish- I sraeli\norigin, and spurn the Arabs around designating them as illiterate meaning\nbrutal, naïve and backward. They desired the wealth of their neighbours to be\nmade lawful to them and they could thus appropriate it the way they liked.\n\"… because they say: \"There is no blame on us to betray and take the\nproperties of the illiterates (Arabs)\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:75]\nReligiously, they showed no zeal; their most obvious religious commodity was\nfortunetelling, witchcraft and the secret arts (blowing on knots), for which they used\nto attach to themselves advantages of science and spiritual precedence.\nThey excelled at the arts of earning money and trading. They in fact monopolized\ntrading in cereals, dates, wine, clothes, export and import. For the services they\noffered to the Arabs, the latter paid heavily. Usury was a common practice amongst\nthem, lending the Arab notables great sums to be squandered on mercenary poets,\nand in vanity avenues, and in return seizing their fertile land given as surety.\nThey were very good at corrupting and scheming. They used to sow seeds of discord\nbetween adjacent tribes and entice each one to hatch plots against the other with\nthe natural corollary of continual exhaustive bloody fighting. Whenever they felt that\nfire of hatred was about to subside, they would nourish it with new means of\nperpetuity so that they could always have the upper hand, and at the same time gain\nheavy interest rates on loans spent on inter- tribal warfare.\nThree famous tribes of Jews constituted the demographic presence in Yathrib (now\nMadinah): Banu Qainuqua‘, allies of Al- Khazraj tribe, Banu An- Nadir and Banu\nQuraizah who allied Al- Aws and inhabited the suburbs of Madinah.\nNaturally they held the new changes with abhorrence and were terribly hateful to\nthem, simply because the Messenger of Allâh was of a different race, and this point\nwas in itself too repugnant for them to reconcile with. Second, Islam came to bring\nabout a spirit of rapport, to terminate the state of enmity and hatred, and to\nestablish a social regime based on denunciation of the prohibited and promotion of\nthe allowed. Adherence to these canons of life implied paving the way for an Arab\nunity that could work to the prejudice of the Jews and their interests at both the\nsocial and economic levels; the Arab tribes would then try to restore their wealth and\nland misappropriated by the Jews through usurious practices.\nThe Jews of course deeply considered all these things ever since they had known\nthat the Islamic Call would try to settle in Yathrib, and it was no surprise to discover\nthat they harboured the most enmity and hatred to Islam and the Messenger [pbuh]\n\n-- 111 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n112\neven though they did not have the courage to uncover their feelings in the\nbeginning.\nThe following incident could attest clearly to that abominable antipathy that the Jews\nharboured towards the new political and religious changes that came to stamp the\nlife of Madinah. Ibn Ishaq, on the authority of the Mother of believers Safiyah [R]Ç\nnarrated: Safiyah, daughter of Huyayi bin Akhtab said: I was the closest child to my\nfather and my uncle Abi Yasir’s heart. Whenever they saw me with a child of theirs,\nthey should pamper me so tenderly to the exclusion of anyone else. However, with\nthe advent of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and setting in Quba’ with Bani ‘Amr bin\n‘Awf, my father, Huyayi bin Akhtab and my uncle Abu Yasir bin Akhtab went to see\nhim and did not return until sunset when they came back walking lazily and fully\ndejected. I, as usually, hurried to meet them smiling, but they would not turn to me\nfor the grief that caught them. I heard my uncle Abu Yasir say to Ubai and Huyayi:\n\"Is it really he (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh])?\" The former said: \"It is he, I swear by\nAllâh!\" \"Did you really recognize him?\" they asked. He answered: \"Yes, and my heart\nis burning with enmity towards him\" [Ibn Hisham 1/518, 519]\nAn interesting story that took place on the first day, the Prophet [pbuh] stepped in\nMadinah, could be quoted to illustrate the mental disturbance and deep anxiety that\nbeset the Jews. ‘Abdullah bin Salam, the most learned rabbi among the Jews came\nto see the Prophet [pbuh] when he arrived, and asked him certain questions to\nascertain his real Prophethood. No sooner did he hear the Prophet’s answers than he\nembraced Islam, but added that if his people knew of his Islamization they would\nadvance false arguments against me. The Prophet [pbuh] sent for some Jews and\nasked them about ‘Abdullah bin Salam, they testified to his scholarly aptitude and\nvirtuous standing. Here it was divulged to them that he had embraced Islam and on\nthe spot, they imparted categorically opposite testimonies and described him as the\nmost evil of all evils. In another narration ‘Abdullah bin Salam said, \"O Jews! Be\nAllâh fearing. By Allâh, the only One, you know that he is the Messenger of Allâh\nsent to people with the Truth.\" They replied, \"You are lying.\" ... That was the\nProphet’s first experience with the Jews. [Bukhari 1/459]\nThat was the demo- political picture within Madinah. Five hundred kilometres away in\nMakkah, there still lay another source of detrimental threat, the archenemy of Islam,\nQuraish. For ten years, while at the mercy of Quraish, the Muslims were subjected to\nall sorts of terrorism, boycott, harassment and starvation coupled by a large scale\npainstaking psychological war and aggressive organized propaganda. When they had\nemigrated to Madinah, their land, wealth and property were seized, wives detained\nand the socially humble in rank brutally tortured. Quraish also schemed and made\nattempts on the life of the first figure of the Call, Muhammad [pbuh] . Due to their\nacknowledged temporal leadership and religious supremacy among the pagan Arabs,\ngiven the custodianship of the Sacred Sanctuary, the Quraishites spared no effort in\nenticing the Arabians against Madinah and boycotting the Madinese socially and\neconomically. To quote Muhammad Al- Ghazali: \"A state of war virtually existed\nbetween the Makkan tyrants and the Muslims in their abode. It is foolish to blame\nthe Muslims for the horrible consequences that were bound to ensue in the light of\nthat long- standing feud.\" [Fiqh As-Seerah p.162]\nThe Muslims in Madinah were completely eligible then to confiscate the wealth of\nthose tyrants, mete out for them exemplary punishment and bring twofold retaliation\n\n-- 112 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n113\non them in order to deter them from committing any folly against the Muslims and\ntheir sanctities.\nThat was a resume of the major problems that the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] had\nto face, and the complicated issues he was supposed to resolve.\nIn full acknowledgment, we could safely say that he quite honestly shouldered the\nresponsibilities of Messengership, and cleverly discharged the liabilities of both\ntemporal and religious leadership in Madinah. He accorded to everyone his due\nportion whether of mercy or punishment, with the former usually seasoning the\nlatter in the overall process of establishing Islam on firm grounds among its faithful\nadherents.\n\n-- 113 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n114\nThe First Phase: The Status Quo in Madinah at the Time of Emigration\nEmigration to Madinah could never be attributable to attempts to escape from jeers\nand oppression only, but it also constituted a sort of cooperation with the aim of\nerecting the pillars of a new society in a secure place. Hence it was incumbent upon\nevery capable Muslim to contribute to building this new homeland, immunizing it and\nholding up its prop. As a leader and spiritual guide, there was no doubt the Noble\nMessenger [pbuh], in whose hands exclusively all affairs would be resolved.\nIn Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] had to deal with three distinctively different\ncategories of people with different respective problems:\n1. \tHis Companions, the noble and Allâh fearing elite [R]\n2. \tPolytheists still detached from the Islam and were purely\nMadinese tribes.\n3. \tThe Jews.\n1. \tAs for his Companions, the conditions of life in Madinah were totally different\nfrom those they experienced in Makkah. There, in Makkah, they used to strive\nfor one corporate target, but physically, they were scattered, overpowered\nand forsaken. They were helpless in terms of pursuing their new course of\norientation. Their means, socially and materially, fell short of establishing a\nnew Muslim community. In parallel lines, the Makkan Chapters of the Noble\nQur’ân were confined to delineating the Islamic precepts, enacting legislations\npertaining to the believers individually and enjoining good and piety and\nforbidding evils and vices.\nIn Madinah , things were otherwise; here all the affairs of their life rested in\ntheir hands. Now, they were at ease and could quite confidently handle the\nchallenges of civilization, construction, means of living, economics, politics,\ngovernment administration, war and peace, codification of the questions of\nthe allowed and prohibited, worship, ethics and all the relevant issues. In a\nnutshell, they were in Madinah at full liberty to erect the pillars of a new\nMuslim community not only utterly different from that pre- Islamic code of life,\nbut also distinctive in its features in the world at large. It was a society that\ncould stand for the Islamic Call for whose sake the Muslims had been put to\nunspeakable tortures for 10 years. No doubt, the construction of a society\nthat runs in line with this type of ethics cannot be accomplished overnight,\nwithin a month or a year. It requires a long time to build during which\nlegislation and legalization will run gradually in a complementary process with\nmind cultivation, training and education. Allâh, the All- Knowing, of course\nundertook legislation and His Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], implementation\nand orientation:\n\"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger\n(Muhammad [pbuh]) from among themselves, reciting to them His\nVerses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism),\nand teaching them the Book (this Qur’ân, Islamic laws and Islamic\nJurisprudence) and \tAl- Hikmah \t(As- Sunna: legal ways, orders, acts of\nworship, etc. of the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh].).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 62:2]\n\n-- 114 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n115\nThe Prophet’s Companions [R] , rushed enthusiastically to assimilate these\nQur’ânic rules and fill their hearts joyfully with them:\n\" And when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e.\nthe Verses) increase their Faith.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:2]\nWith respect to the Muslims, this task constituted the greatest challenge for\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. In fact, this very purpose lay at the heart of\nthe Islamic Call and the Muhammadan mission; it was never an incidental\nissue though there were the matters that required urgent addressing.\nThe Muslims in Madinah consisted virtually of two parties: The first one\nalready settled down in their abode, land and wealth, fully at ease, but seeds\nof discord amongst them were deeply seated and chronic enmity continually\nevoked; they were \tAl- Ansar \t(the Helpers). The second party were \tAl-\nMuhajirun \t(the Emigrants), homeless, jobless and penniless. Their number\nwas not small, on the contrary, it was increasing day by day after the Prophet\n[pbuh] had given them the green light to leave for Madinah whose economic\nstructure, originally not that prosperous one, began to show signs of\nimbalance aggravated by the economic boycott that the anti- Islamic groups\nimposed and consequently imports diminished and living conditions worsened.\n2. \tThe purely Madinese polytheists constituted the second sector with whom the\nProphet [pbuh] had to deal. Those people had no control at all over the\nMuslim. Some of them nursed no grudge against the Muslims, but were rather\nskeptical of their ancestors’ religious practices, and developed tentative\ninclination towards Islam and before long they embraced the new faith and\nwere truly devoted to Allâh. However, some others harboured evil intentions\nagainst the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers but were too cowardly to resist\nthem publicly, they were rather, under those Islamically favourable\nconditions, obliged to fake amicability and friendliness. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai,\nwho had almost been given presidency over Al- Khazraj and Al- Aws tribes in\nthe wake of Bu‘ath War between the two tribes, came at the head of that\ngroup of hypocrites.

The land,\nwhich belonged to two orphans, was purchased. The Prophet [pbuh] himself\ncontributed to building the Mosque by carrying adobe bricks and stones while reciting\nverses:\n\"O Allâh! no bliss is there but that of the Hereafter, I beseech you to forgive\nthe Emigrants and Helpers.\"\nThe ground was cleared, of weeds and shrubs, palm trees and rubbish, the graves of\nthe polytheists dug up and then levelled and the trees planted around. The \tQiblah\n(the direction in which the Muslims turn their faces in prayer) was constructed to\nface Jerusalem; two beams were also erected to hold the ceiling up. It was square in\nform, each side measuring approximately 100 yards, facing towards the north and\nhaving three gates on each of the remaining sides. Nearby, rooms reserved for the\nProphet’s household were built of stones and adobe bricks with ceilings of palm\nleaves. \t[Bukhari 1/71,555,560; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/56] \tTo the north of the Mosque a place was\nreserved for the Muslims who had neither family nor home. The \tAdhân \t(summoning\nthe Muslims to the Mosque by the Call for prayer) was initiated at this early stage of\npost- migration era. The Mosque was not merely a locus to perform prayers, but\nrather an Islamic league where the Muslim’s were instructed in Islam and its\ndoctrines. It served as an assembly place where the conflicting pre- Islamic trends\nused to come to terms; it was the headquarter wherein all the affairs of the Muslims\nwere administered, and consultative and executive councils held.\nThe Mosque being thus constructed, the Prophet [pbuh] next turned his attention to\ncementing the ties of mutual brotherhood amongst the Muslims of Madinah, \tAl- Ansar\n(the Helpers) and \tAl- Muhajirun \t(the Emigrants). It was indeed unique in the history\nof the world. A gathering of 90 men, half of whom Emigrants and the others Helpers\nassembled in the house of Anas bin Malik where the Prophet [pbuh] gave the spirit of\nbrotherhood his official blessing. When either of the two persons who had been\npaired as brothers, passed away, his property was inherited by his brother- in- faith.\nThis practice continued till the following verse was revealed at the time of the battle\nof Badr, and the regular rule of inheritance was allowed to take its usual course:\n\"But kindred by blood are nearer to one another regarding inheritance \t[Za'd\nAl- Ma'ad 2/56] .\" [Al- Qur'an 8:75]\n\"Brotherhood- in- faith\" to quote Muhammad Al- Ghazali again, \"was holding\nsubordinate every distinction of race and kindred and supporting the Islamic precept:\nnone is superior to the other except on the basis of piety and God- fearing. \t[Fiqh As-\nSeerah p140,141] \"\n\n-- 118 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n119\nThe Prophet [pbuh] attached to that brotherhood a valid contract; it was not just\nmeaningless words but rather a valid practice relating to blood and wealth rather\nthan a passing whim taking the form of accidental greeting.\nThe atmosphere of brotherhood and fellow- feeling created a spirit of selflessness\ninfused deeply in the hearts of his followers, and produced very healthy results. For\nexample, Sa‘d bin Ar- Rabi‘, a Helper, said to his fellow brother ‘Abdur Rahman bin\n‘Awf, \"I am the richest man amongst the Helpers. I am glad to share my property\nhalf and half with you. I have two wives, I am ready to divorce one and after the\nexpiry of her ‘Iddah, (the prescribed period for a woman divorcee to stay within her\nhouse unmarried) you may marry her.\" But ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf was not\nprepared to accept anything: neither property nor home. So he blessed his brother\nand said: \"Kindly direct me to the market so that I may make my fortune with my\nown hands.\" And he did prosper and got married very shortly by his own labour.\n[Bukhari 1/553]\nThe Helpers were extremely generous to their brethren- in- faith. Abu Hurairah\nreported that they once approached the Prophet [pbuh] with the request that their\norchards of palm trees should be distributed equally between the Muslims of Madinah\nand their brethren from Makkah. But the Prophet [pbuh] was reluctant to put this\nheavy burden upon them. It was, however, decided that the Emigrants would work\nin the orchards alongwith the Helpers and the yield would be divided equally\namongst them. \t[Bukhari 1/312]\nSuch examples point directly to the spirit of sacrifice, altruism and cordiality on the\npart of the Helpers, and also to the feeling of appreciation, gratitude and self- respect\nthat the Emigrants held dear to their hearts. They took only what helped them eke a\nreasonable living. In short, this policy of mutual brotherhood was so wise and timely\nthat many obstinate problems were resolved wonderfully and reasonably.\nA Charter of Islamic Alliance\nJust as the Prophet [pbuh] had established a code of brotherhood amongst the\nbelievers, so too he was keen on establishing friendly relations between the Muslims\nand non- Muslim tribes of Arabia. He established a sort of treaty aiming at ruling out\nall pre- Islamic rancour and inter- tribal feuds. He was so meticulous not to leave any\narea in the charter that would allow pre- Islamic traditions to sneak in or violate the\nnew environment he wanted to establish. Herein, we look over some of its\nprovisions.\nIn the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This is a document\nfrom Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, concerning Emigrants and Helpers and\nthose who followed and strove with them.\n1. \tThey are one nation to the exclusion of other people.\n2. \tThe Emigrants of Quraish unite together and shall pay blood money among\nthemselves, and shall ransom honourably their prisoners. Every tribe of the\nHelpers unite together, as they were at first, and every section among them\nwill pay a ransom for acquitting its relative prisoners.\n3. \tBelievers shall not leave anyone destitute among them by not paying his\nredemption money or blood money in kind.\n\n-- 119 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n120\n4. \tWhoever is rebellious or whoever seeks to spread enmity and sedition, the\nhand of every God- fearing Muslim shall be against him, even if he be his son.\n5. \tA believer shall not kill another believer, nor shall support a disbeliever\nagainst a believer.\n6. \tThe protection of Allâh is one (and is equally) extended to the humblest of the\nbelievers.\n7. \tThe believers are supported by each other.\n8. \tWhosoever of the Jews follows us shall have aid and succour; they shall not\nbe injured, nor any enemy be aided against them.\n9. \tThe peace of the believers is indivisible. No separate peace shall be made\nwhen believers are fighting in the way of Allâh. Conditions must be fair and\nequitable to all.\n10. \tIt shall not be lawful for a believer, who holds by what is in this\ndocument and believes in Allâh and the Day of Judgement, to help a criminal\nnor give him refuge. Those who give him refuge and render him help shall\nhave the curse and anger of Allâh on the Day of Resurrection. Their indemnity\nis not accepted.\n11. \tWhenever you differ about a matter, it must be referred to Allâh and\nto Muhammad. [Ibn Hisham 1/502,503]\n12. \tKilling a believer deliberately with no good reason entails killing the\nkiller unless the sponsor deems it otherwise.\nIt was solely by his wisdom and dexterity, that the Prophet [pbuh] erected the pillars\nof the new society. This phenomenon no doubt left its mark on the virtuous Muslims.\nHe used to bring them up in the light of the Islamic education, he sanctified their\nselves, enjoined them to observe righteousness and praiseworthy manners and was\nkeen on infusing into them the ethics of amity, glory, honour, worship and first and\nforemost obedience to Allâh and His Messenger.\nThe following is a cluster of the virtues he used to inculcate in the minds of his\nfollowers:\nA man asked the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] which of the merits is superior in Islam.\nHe (the Prophet [pbuh]) remarked:\n\"That you provide food and extend greetings to one whom you know or do\nnot know.\"[Bukhari 1/6,9]\n‘Abdullah bin Salâm said: When the Prophet [pbuh] arrived in Madinah, I went to see\nhim and I immediately recognized through his features that he would never be a liar.\nThe first things he (the Prophet [pbuh]) said was:\n\"Extend peace greetings amongst yourselves, provide food to the needy,\nmaintain uterine relations, observe prayer at night while people are asleep,\nthen you will peacefully enter the Garden (Paradise).\"[Narrated by At-Tirmidhi; Mishkat Al-\nMasabih 1/168]\nAnd he said:\n\n-- 120 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n121\n\"The Muslim is that one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are\nsafe.[Bukhari 1/6] \"\nAnd said:\n\"None amongst you believes (truly) till one likes for his brother that which\nhe loves for himself.[ibid 1/6] \"\nAnd said:\n\"He will not enter Paradise, he whose neighbour is not secure from his\nwrongful conduct.[Narrated by Muslim; Mishkat Al- Masabih 2/422] \"\nAnd said:\n\"A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim; he neither oppresses him nor does he\nfail him. Whosoever removes a worldly grief from a believer, Allâh will\nremove from him one of the griefs of the Day of Judgement. Whosoever\nshields a Muslim, Allâh will shield him on the Day of Resurrection.[Mishkat Al-\nMasabih 2/422; Sahih Al- Bukhari; Sahih Muslim] \"\nAnd said:\n\"Abusing a Muslim is an outrage and fighting against him is disbelief.[Bukhari\n2/893] \"\nAnd said:\n\"To remove something harmful from the road, is charity.[Mishkat Al- Masabih 1/12] \"\nAnd said:\n\"Charity erases sins just as water extinguishes fire.[ibid 1/14] \"\nAnd said:\n\"He is not a perfect believer, who goes to bed full and knows that his\nneighbour is hungry.[ibid 2/424] \"\nAnd said:\n\"Show mercy to people on earth so that Allâh will have mercy on you in\nheaven.[Sunan Abu Da'ud 2/235] \"\nAnd said:\n\"Try to avert fire even by half a date (in charity) if not by tendering a good\nword. \t[Bukhari 2/190] \"\nAnd said:\n\n-- 121 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n122\n\"Clothing an under- clad Muslim, entitles you to a garment from the\nParadise; feeding a hungry Muslim will make you eligible (by Allâh’s Will)\nfor the fruit of the Paradise, and if you provide water to a thirsty Muslim,\nAllâh will provide you with a drink from ‘the Sealed Nectar’.[Mishkat Al- Masabih\n1/169] \"\nHe used as well to exhort the believers to spend in charity reminding them of\nrelevant virtues for which the hearts yearn.\nHe said:\n\"The believers in their mutual love, are like the human body where when\nthe eye is in agony, the entire body feels the pain; when the head aches, all\nthe body will suffer. \t[Narrated by Muslim] \"\nAnd said:\n\"The bonds of brotherhood between two Muslims are like parts of a house,\none part strengthens and holds the other.[Bukhari 2/890] \t\"\nAnd said:\n\"Do not have malice against a Muslim; do not be envious of other Muslims;\ndo not go against a Muslim and forsake him. O the slaves of Allâh! Be like\nbrothers with each other. It is not violable for a Muslim to desert his brother\nfor over three days.[Bukhari 2/896] \"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] used as well to promote that habit of abstention from asking the\nothers for help unless one is totally helpless. He used to talk to his companions a lot\nabout the merits, virtues and Divine reward implied in observing the prescribed\nworships and rituals. He would always bring forth corroborated proofs in order to link\nthem physically and spiritually to the Revelation sent to him, hence he would apprise\nthem of their duties and responsibilities in terms of the consequences of the Call of\nIslam, and at the same time emphasize the exigencies of comprehension and\ncontemplation.\nThat was his practice of maximizing their morale and imbuing them with the noble\nvalues and ideals so that they could become models of virtue to be copied by\nsubsequent generations.\n‘Abdullah bin Mas‘ud [R] once said: If you are willing to follow a good example, then\nyou can have a recourse in the tradition of the deceased, because the living are likely\nto fall an easy victim to oppression (so they might waver in faith). Follow the steps\nof Muhammad’s Companions. They were the best in this nation, the most pious, the\nmost learned and the least pretentious. Allâh chose them to accompany the Prophet\n[pbuh] and establish His religion. Therefore, it is imperative to get to know their\ngrace, follow their righteous way and adhere as much as you can to their manners\nand assimilate their biography. They were always on the orthodox path. There is\nthen the great Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] whose moral visible attributes, aspects of\nperfection, talents, virtues, noble manners and praiseworthy deeds, entitle him to\noccupy the innermost cells of our hearts, and become the dearest target that the self\n\n-- 122 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n123\nyearns for. Hardly did he utter a word when his Companions would race to assimilate\nit and work in its light. [Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/32]\nThose were the attributes and qualities on whose basis the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to\nbuild a new society, the most wonderful and the most honourable society ever known\nin history. On these grounds, he strove to resolve the longstanding problems, and\nlater gave mankind the chance to breathe a sigh of relief after a long wearying\njourney in dark and gloomy avenues. Such lofty morale lay at the very basis of\ncreating a new society with integrated components immune to all fluctuations of\ntime, and powerful enough to change the whole course of humanity.\n\n-- 123 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n124\nA Cooperation and Non-Aggression Pact with the Jews\nSoon after emigrating to Madinah and making sure that the pillars of the new Islamic\ncommunity were well established on strong bases of administrative, political and\nideological unity, the Prophet [pbuh] commenced to establish regular and clearly-\ndefined relations with non- Muslims. All of these efforts were exerted solely to provide\npeace, security, and prosperity to all mankind at large, and to bring about a spirit of\nrapport and harmony within his region, in particular.\nGeographically, the closest people to Madinah were the Jews. Whilst harbouring evil\nintentions, and nursing bitter grudge, they showed not the least resistance nor the\nslightest animosity. The Prophet decided to ratify a treaty with them with clauses\nthat provided full freedom in faith and wealth. He had no intention whatsoever of\nfollowing severe policies involving banishment, seizure of wealth and land or\nhostility.\nThe treaty came within the context of another one of a larger framework relating to\ninter- Muslim relationships.\nThe most important provisions of the treaty are the following:\n1. \tThe Jews of Bani ‘Awf are one community with the believers. The Jews will\nprofess their religion, and the Muslims theirs.\n2. \tThe Jews shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for\ntheirs.\n3. \tIf attacked by a third party, each shall come to the assistance of the other.\n4. \tEach party shall hold counsel with the other. Mutual relation shall be founded\non righteousness; sin is totally excluded.\n5. \tNeither shall commit sins to the prejudice of the other.\n6. \tThe wronged party shall be aided.\n7. \tThe Jews shall contribute to the cost of war so long as they are fighting\nalongside the believers.\n8. \tMadinah shall remain sacred and inviolable for all that join this treaty.\n9. \tShould any disagreement arise between the signatories to this treaty, then\nAllâh, the All- High and His Messenger shall settle the dispute.\n10. \tThe signatories to this treaty shall boycott Quraish commercially; they\nshall also abstain from extending any support to them.\n11. \tEach shall contribute to defending Madinah, in case of a foreign attack,\nin its respective area.\n12. \tThis treaty shall not hinder either party from seeking lawful revenge.[Ibn Hisham\n1/503,504]\nMadinah and its suburbs, after the ratification of this treaty, turned into a coalition\nstate, with Madinah proper as capital and Muhammad [pbuh] as ‘president’;\nauthorities lay mainly in the hand of the Muslims, and consequently it was a real\ncapital of Islam. To expand the zone of peace and security the Prophet [pbuh]\nstarted to enter into similar treaties with other tribes living around ‘his state’.\n\n-- 124 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n125\nThe Prophet on the Battlefield\nThe Quraishites, mortified at the escape of the Prophet [pbuh] along with his\ndevoted companions, and jealous of his growing power in Madinah, kept a stringent\nwatch over the Muslims left behind and persecuted them in every possible way. They\nalso initiated clandestine contacts with ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, chief of Madinese\npolytheists, and president designate of the tribes ‘Aws and Khazraj before the\nProphet’s emigration. They sent him a strongly- worded ultimatum ordering him to\nfight or expel the Prophet, otherwise they would launch a widespread military\ncampaign that would exterminate his people and proscribe his women. \t[Narrated by Abu\nDa'ud]\nHis pride wounded and kingship no longer his, ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, a priori\nresponded positively to his Quraishite co- polytheists. He mobilized his supporters to\ncounteract the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] on hearing about this unholy alliance,\nsummoned ‘Abdullah and admonished him to be more sensible and thoughtful and\ncautioned his men against being snared in malicious tricks. \t[Narrated by Abu Da'ud] \tThe\nmen, on grounds of cowardice, or reason, gave up the idea. Their chief, however,\nseemingly complied, but at heart, he remained a wicked unpredictable accomplice\nwith Quraish and the envious Jews. Skirmishes and provocations started to pave the\nway for a major confrontation between the Muslims and polytheists. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh,\nan outstanding Helper, announced his intention to observe \t‘Umrah \t(lesser\npilgrimage) and headed for Makkah. There Omaiya bin Khalaf provided tutelage for\nhim to observe the ritual circumambulation. Abu Jahl, an archenemy of Islam saw\nhim in the Sacred Sanctuary and threatened he would have killed him if he had not\nbeen in the company of Omaiya. Sa‘d, fearlessly and defiantly, challenged him to\ncommitting any folly at the risk of cutting their caravans off. [Bukhari 2/563]\nProvocative actions continued and Quraish sent the Muslims a note threatening to\nput them to death in their own homeland. Those were not mere words, for the\nProphet [pbuh] received information from reliable sources attesting to real intrigues\nand plots being hatched by the enemies of Islam. Precautionary measures were\ntaken and a state of alertness was called for, including the positioning of security\nguards around the house of the Prophet [pbuh] and strategic junctures. ‘Aishah [R]\nreported that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] lay down on bed during one night on his\narrival in Madinah and said: Were there a pious person from amongst my\nCompanions who should keep a watch for me during the night? She (‘Aishah [R])\nsaid: We were in this state when we heard the clanging noise of arms. He (the\nProphet [pbuh]) said: Who is it? He said: This is Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas. Allâh’s\nMessenger [pbuh] said to him: What brings you here? Thereupon he said: I\nharboured fear (lest any harm should come to) Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh], so I came\nto serve as your sentinel. Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] invoked blessings upon him and\nthen he slept. [Muslim 2/280; Bukhari 1/404]\nThis state of close vigilance continued ceaselessly until the Words of Allâh were\nrevealed saying:\n\"Allâh will protect you from mankind.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 5:67]\nHere, the Prophet [pbuh] peeped from the dome of his house asking his people to go\naway, and making it clear that Allâh would take the charge of protecting him. \t[At-Tirmidhi\n2/130]\n\n-- 125 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n126\nThe Prophet’s life was not the only target of the wicked schemes, but rather the lives\nand the whole entity of the Muslims. When the Madinese provided the Prophet\n[pbuh] and his Companions with safe refuge, the desert bedouins began to look at\nthem all in the same perspective, and outlawed all the Muslims.\nAt this precarious juncture with Quraish, intent on pursuing their aggressive and\ndevilish plans, Allâh, the All- High, gave the Muslims the permission to take arms\nagainst the disbelievers:\n\"Permission to fight is given to those (i.e. believers against those\ndisbelievers), who are fighting them, (and) because they (believers) have\nbeen wronged, and surely Allâh is Able to give them (believers) victory.\"\n[Al- Qur'an 22:39]\nThis verse was revealed in a larger context of Divine instructions to eradicate all\naspects of falsehood, and hold in honour the symbols and rites of Allâh:\n\"Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order\nfor \tIqamat- as- Salât: [i.e. to perform \tSalât \t(prayer) — the five compulsory,\ncongregational prayers (the males in Mosques)], to pay the \tZakat\n(obligatory charity), and they enjoin \tAl- Ma‘ruf \t(i.e. Islamic Monotheism and\nall that Islam orders one to do), and forbid \tAl- Munkar \t(i.e. disbelief,\npolytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as\nthe Law of their country in all the spheres of life].\" \t[Al- Qur'an 22:41].\nDoubtlessly, the permission to fight was revealed in Madinah after emigration, not in\nMakkah, still the exact date where of is in doubt.\nThe permission to fight was already there, but in the light of the status quo, it was\nwise for the Muslims to bring the commercial routes leading to Makkah under their\ncontrol. To realize this strategic objective, the Prophet [pbuh] had to choose either of\ntwo options:\na. \tEntering into non- aggression pacts with the tribes inhabiting either the areas\nadjacent to the routes or between these routes and Madinah. With respect to\nthis course of action, the Prophet [pbuh] had already signed, together with\nthe Jews and other neighbouring tribes, the aforementioned pact of\ncooperation and good neighbourliness.\nb. \tDes",
  "patching successive armed missions for harassment along the strategic\ncommercial routs.\nPre-Badr Missions and Invasions\nWith a view to implementing these plans, the Muslims commenced real military\nactivities, which at first took the form of reconnaissance patrols delegated to explore\nthe geopolitical features of the roads surrounding Madinah and others leading to\nMakkah, and building alliances with the tribes nearby. The Prophet wanted to\nimpress upon the polytheists and Jews of Madinah as well as the bedouins in its\nvicinity, that the Muslims had smashed their old fears, and had been too strong to be\nattacked with impunity. He also wanted to display the power of his followers in order\nto deter Quraish from committing any military folly against him which might\n\n-- 126 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n127\njeopardize their economic life and means of living, and to stop them from\npersecuting the helpless Muslims detained in Makkah, consequently he would avail\nhimself of this opportunity and resume his job of propagating the Divine Call freely.\nThe following is a resume of these missions and errands:\n1. \tSaif Al- Bahr Platoon sent in Ramadan 1 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. led by Hamzah bin\n‘Abdul Muttalib and comprising 30 Emigrants with a definite task of\nintercepting a caravan belonging to Quraish. It was a caravan of 300 people\nincluding Abu Jahl bin Hisham. The two parties encountered each other and\naligned in preparation for fighting. Majdi bin ‘Amr, on good terms with both\nsides, happened to be there and managed to prevent an imminent clash.\nOn that occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] accredited the first flag in the history of\nMuslims. It was white in colour and was entrusted to Kinaz bin Husain Al-\nGhanawi, to carry.\n2. \tIn Shawwal, 1 A.H., i.e. April 623 A.D. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\ndespatched ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Harith bin Al- Muttalib at the head of 60 horsemen\nof Emigrants to a spot called Batn Rabegh where they encountered Abu\nSufyan at the head of a caravan of 200 men. There was arrow shooting but\nno actual fighting.\nIt is interesting to note that two Muslims, Al- Miqdad bin ‘Amr Al- Bahrani and\n‘Utbah bin Ghazwan Al- Mazini, defected from the caravan of Quraish and\njoined the ranks of ‘Ubaidah. The Muslims had a white flag carried by Mistah\nbin Athatha bin Al- Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf.\n3. \tIn Dhul Qa‘dah 1 A.H., i.e. May 623 A.D. the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Sa‘d\nbin Abi Waqqas at the head of 20 horsemen, and instructed them not to go\nbeyond Al- Kharrar. After a five- day march they reached the spot to discover\nthat the camels of Quraish had left the day before; their flag, as usual, was\nwhite and carried by Al- Miqdad bin ‘Amr.\n4. \tGhazwa Al- Abwa’ or Waddan. It was in Safar 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] set out himself at the head of 70 men, mostly\nEmigrants, to intercept a camel caravan belonging to Quraish, leaving behind\nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah to dispose the affairs in Madinah. When he reached Waddan,\na place between Makkah and Madinah, he found none.\nIn the process of this campaign, he contracted a non- aggression pact with\n‘Amr bin Makhshi Ad- Damari. The provisions of the pact go as follows:\n\"This is a document from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh concerning Bani\nDamrah in which he established them safe and secure in their wealth and\nlives. They can expect support from the Muslims unless they oppose the\nreligion of Allâh. They are also expected to respond positively in case the\nProphet sought their help.[]\"\nThis was the first invasion under the leadership of the Messenger of Allâh. It\ntook fifteen days, with a white flag carried by Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib.\n\n-- 127 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n128\n5. \tBuwat Invasion. It took place in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. The\nProphet [pbuh], at the head of 200 companions, marched for Buwat to\nintercept a caravan belonging to Quraish comprising 100 Quraishites, Omaiya\nbin Khalaf among them, and 2500 camels. When he reached Buwat, the\ncaravan had left. Before leaving Madinah, he mandated Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh to\ndispose the affairs until his return.\n6. \tSafwan Invasion. In Rabi‘ Al- Awwal 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. Karz bin Jabir at the\nhead of a small group of polytheists raided the pastures of Madinah and\nlooted some animals. The Prophet [pbuh] at the head of 70 men left Madinah\nto fight the aggressors. He went in their pursuit till he reached a place called\nSafwan near Badr but could not catch up with them. This invasion came to be\nknown as the preliminary Badr Invasion. During his absence, the Prophet\n[pbuh] entrusted Zaid bin Harithah with the disposition of the affairs in\nMadinah. The standard was white in colour and entrusted to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib\nto carry.\n7. \tDhil ‘Ushairah Invasion. It was in Jumada- al- Ula and Jumada- al- Akhirah the\nfirst or second 2 A.H., i.e. November- December 623 A.D. The Prophet [pbuh]\nat the head of 150- 200 Muslim volunteers, with 30 camels which they rode\nturn by turn, set out to intercept a Quraishite caravan. He reached Dhil\n‘Ushairah but the camels had left some days before. These camels were the\nsame that he went out to intercept on their return from Syria, and were the\ndirect reason for the break out of the battle of Badr. In the process of this\ncampaign, the Prophet [pbuh] contracted a non- aggression pact with Bani\nMadlij and their allies Bani Dhumrah. Abu Salama bin ‘Abd Al- Asad Al-\nMakhzumi was mandated to rule Madinah in his absence.\n8. \tThe Platoon of Nakhlah. It took place in Rajab 2 A.H., i.e. January 624 A.H.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh Asadi to\nNakhlah at the head of 12 Emigrants with six camels. ‘Abdullah was given a\nletter by the Prophet [pbuh] but was instructed to read it only after two days.\nHe followed the instructions and discovered that he was asked to go on to a\nplace called Nakhlah standing between Makkah and At- Ta’if, intercept a\ncaravan for Quraish and collect news about their intentions. He disclosed the\ncontents of the letters to his fellows who blindly obeyed the orders. At\nNakhlah, the caravan passed carrying loads of raisins (dried grapes), food\nstuff and other commodities. Notable polytheists were also there such as ‘Amr\nbin Al- Hadrami, ‘Uthman and Naufal, sons of ‘Abdullah bin Al- Mugheerah and\nothers... The Muslims held consultations among themselves with respect to\nfighting them taking into account Rajab which was a sacred month (during\nwhich, along with Dhul Hijja, Dhul Qa‘da and Muharram, war activities were\nsuspended as was the custom in Arabia then). At last they agreed to engage\nwith them in fighting. ‘Amr bin Al- Hadrami was shot dead by an arrow,\n‘Uthman and Al- Hakam were captured whereas Naufal escaped. They came\nback with the booty and the two prisoners. They set aside one- fifth of the\nbooty assigned to Allâh and His Messenger, and took the rest. The Messenger\ndisapproved of that act and suspended any action as regards the camels and\nthe two captives on account of the prohibited months already mentioned. The\npolytheists, on their part, exploited this golden opportunity to calumniate the\nMuslims and accuse them of violating what is Divinely inviolable. This idle talk\nbrought about a painful headache to Muhammad’s Companions, until at last\nthey were relieved when the Revelation came down giving a decisive answer\nand stating quite explicitly that the behaviour of the polytheists in the whole\n\n-- 128 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n129\nprocess was much more heinous and far more serious than the act of the\nMuslims:\n\"They ask you concerning fighting in the sacred months (i.e. 1st, 7th,\n11th and 12th months of the Islamic calendar). Say, ‘Fighting therein\nis a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allâh is\nto prevent mankind from following the way of Allâh, to disbelieve in\nHim, to prevent access to \tAl- Masjid- Al- Harâm \t(at Makkah), and to\ndrive out its inhabitants, and \tAl- Fitnah \tis worse than killing.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 2:217]\nThe Words of Allâh were quite clear and said that the tumult created by the\npolytheists was groundless. The sacred inviolable sanctities had been repeatedly\nviolated in the long process of fighting Islam and persecuting its adherents. The\nwealth of the Muslims as well as their homes had already been violated and their\nProphet [pbuh] had been the target of repeated attempts on his life. In short, that\nsort of propaganda could deservedly be described as impudence and prostitution.\nThis has been a resume of pre- Badr platoons and invasions. None of them witnessed\nany sort of looting property or killing people except when the polytheists had\ncommitted such crimes under the leadership of Karz bin Jabir Al- Fahri. It was, in\nfact, the polytheists who had initiated such acts. No wonder, for such ill- behaviour is\nimmanent in their natural disposition.\nShortly afterwards, the two captives were released and blood money was given to\nthe killed man’s father.[For details see Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/83-85; Ibn Hisham 1/605; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/115, 2/468]\nAfter this event, Quraish began to realize the real danger that Madinah could present\nwith. They came to know that Madinah had always been on the alert, watching\nclosely their commercial caravans. It was then common knowledge to them that the\nMuslims in their new abode could span and extend their military activities over an\narea of 300 miles. and bring it under full control. However, the new situation borne\nin mind, the Makkans could not be deterred and were too obstinate to come to terms\nwith the new rising power of Islam. They were determined to bring their fall by their\nown hands and with this recklessness they precipitated the great battle of Badr.\nThe Muslims, on the other hand, and at the behest of their Lord, were ordered to go\nto war in Sha‘ban 2 A.H:\n\"And fight, in the way of Allâh those who fight you; but transgress not the\nlimits. Truly, Allâh likes not the transgressors. And kill them wherever you\nfind them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And \tAl-\nFitnah \t(polytheism or calamity) is worse than killing. And fight not with\nthem at \tAl- Masjid- Al- Harâm \t(the Sanctuary at Makkah), unless they (first)\nfight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the\nrecompense of the disbelievers. But if they cease, then Allâh is Oft-\nForgiving, Most Merciful. And fight them until there is no more \tFitnah\n(disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allâh) and (all and every\nkind of ) worship is for Allâh (Alone). But if they cease, let there be no\ntransgression except against \tAz- Zalimûn \t(polytheists, and wrong- doers,\netc.)\" \t[Al- Qur'an 2:190- 193]\n\n-- 129 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n130\nBefore long, Allâh again sent the Muslims a different sort of verses whereby teaching\nthem ways of fighting, urging them to go to war and demonstrating relevant rules:\n\"So, when you meet (in fight - \tJihâd \tin Allâh’s cause), those who disbelieve\nsmite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them,\nthen bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is\nthe time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom\n(according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus\n[you are ordered by Allâh to continue in carrying out \tJihâd \tagainst the\ndisbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the punishment in\nthe Hell- fire) or at least come under your protection], but if it had been\nAllâh’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you).\nBut (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those\nwho are killed in the way of Allâh, He will never let their deeds be lost. He\nwill guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which\nHe has made known to them (i.e. they will know their places in Paradise\nmore than they used to know their houses in the world). O you who believe!\nIf you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold\nfirm.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 47:4- 7] [Tafheem\t-ul-Qur'an 5/11]\nShortly afterwards, Allâh began to dispraise the hypocrites, the weak at heart and\ncowardly elements:\n\"But when a decisive \tSûrah \t(explaining and ordering things) is sent down,\nand fighting (Jihâd \t— the holy fighting) is mentioned (i.e. ordained) therein,\nyou will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you\nwith a look of one fainting to death. \" \t[Al- Qur'an 47:20]\nThe prevalent exigencies required as a top priority exhorting the Muslims to fight.\nAny leader with a deep insight would order his soldiers to get ready for any sort of\nemergency, let alone the All- Knowing Exalted Lord, Who is at all times omniscient of\nthe minutest details of affairs. The event of that skirmish with the polytheists dealt a\nheavy blow to the pride of Quraish and created a sort of horrible restlessness\namongst them.\nThe aforementioned Qur’ânic verses, enjoining the Muslims to strive in the cause of\nAllâh, betrayed the proximity of blood clashes that would be crowned by a decisive\nvictory for the Muslims, and final expulsion of polytheists out of the Sacred City,\nMakkah. They referred to rules pertinent to the treatment of captives and\nslaughtering the pagan soldiers till the war ended and laid down its burdens. All of\nthese could act as clues to a final triumph that would envelop the strife of the\nMuslims towards their noble objectives.\nAnother event of great significance featured the same month Sha‘ban 2 A.H., i.e.\nFebruary 624 A.D., which was a Divine injunction ordering that \tAl- Qiblah \tbe changed\nfrom Jerusalem to the Sacred Mosque in Makkah. That was of a great advantage to\nthe Muslims at two levels. First, it brought about a kind of social sifting, so to speak,\nin terms of the hypocrites of the Jews and others weak at heart, and revealed their\ntrue nature and inclinations; the ranks of the Muslims were thereby purged from\nthose discord- prone elements. Second, facing a new \tQiblah, the Sacred Mosque in\nMakkah, refers gently to a new role awaiting the Muslims to take up, and would start\n\n-- 130 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n131\nonly after the repatriation of the Muslims to their Sacred City, Makkah for it is not\nlogical for the Muslims to leave their \tQiblah \tat the mercy of non- Muslims.\nThe Muslims, therefore, at the behest of Allâh and on account of those Divine clues,\naugmented their activities and their tendency towards striving in the cause of Allâh\nand encountering His enemies in a decisive battle were greatly intensified.\n\n-- 131 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n132\nThe Battle of Badr\nThe First Decisive Battle in the History of Islam\nReason of the Battle\nWe have already spoken about Al- ‘Ushairah Invasion when a caravan belonging to\nQuraish had escaped an imminent military encounter with the Prophet [pbuh] and his\nmen. When their return from Syria approached, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched\nTalhah bin ‘Ubaidullâh and Sa‘id bin Zaid northward to scout around for any\nmovements of this sort. The two scouts stayed at Al- Hawra’ for some days until Abu\nSufyan, the leader of the caravan, passed by them. The two men hurried back to\nMadinah and reported to the Prophet [pbuh] their findings. Great wealth amounting\nto 50 thousand gold Dinars guarded by 40 men moving relatively close to Madinah\nconstituted a tempting target for the Muslim military, and provided a potentially\nheavy economic, political and military strike that was bound to shake the entire\nstructure of the Makkan polytheists.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] immediately exhorted the Muslims to rush out and waylay the\ncaravan to make up for their property and wealth they were forced to give up in\nMakkah. He did not give orders binding to everyone, but rather gave them full liberty\nto go out or stay back, thinking that it would be just an errand on a small scale.\nThe Muslim army was made up of 300- 317 men, 82- 86 Emigrants, 61 from Aws and\n170 from Khazraj. They were not well- equipped nor adequately prepared. They had\nonly two horses belonging to Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam and Al- Miqdad bin Al- Aswad\nAl- Kindi, 70 camels, one for two or three men to ride alternatively. The Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] himself, ‘Ali and Murthid bin Abi Murthid Al- Ghanawi had only one\ncamel. Disposition of the affairs of Madinah was entrusted to Ibn Umm Maktum but\nlater to Abu Lubabah bin ‘Abdul Mundhir. The general leadership was given to Mus‘ab\nbin ‘Umair Al- Qurashi Al- ‘Abdari, and their standard was white in colour. The little\narmy was divided into two battalions, the Emigrants with a standard raised by ‘Ali\nbin Abi Talib, and the Helpers whose standard was in the hand of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh.\nAz- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam was appointed to the leadership of the right flank, Al-\nMiqdad bin ‘Amr to lead the left flank, and the rear of the army was at the command\nof Qais bin Abi Sa‘sa‘ah. The General Commander- in- Chief was the Prophet [pbuh],\nof course.\nThe Prophet [pbuh], at the head of his army, marched out along the main road\nleading to Makkah. He then turned left towards Badr and when he reached As- Safrâ’,\nhe despatched two men to scout about for the camels of Quraish.\nAbu Sufyan, on the other hand, was on the utmost alert. He had already been aware\nthat the route he was following was attended with dangers. He was also anxious to\nknow about the movements of Muhammad [pbuh]. His scouting men submitted to\nhim reports to the effect that the Muslims were lying in ambush for his caravan. To\nbe on the safe side, he hired Damdam bin ‘Amr Al- Ghifari to communicate a message\nasking for help from the Quraishites. The messenger rode fast and reached Makkah\nin frenzy. Felling himself from his camel, he stood dramatically before Al- Ka‘bah, cut\noff the nose and the ears of the camel, turned its saddle upside down, tore off his\nown shirt from front and behind, and cried: \"O Quraish! Your merchandise! It is with\n\n-- 132 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n133\nAbu Sufyan. The caravan is being intercepted by Muhammad [pbuh] and his\ncompanions. I cannot say what would have happened to them. Help! Help!\"\nThe effect of this hue and cry was instantaneous and the news stunned Quraish and\nthey immediately remembered their pride that was wounded when the Muslims had\nintercepted Al- Hadrami caravan. They therefore swiftly mustered almost all of their\nforces and none stayed behind except Abu Lahab, who delegated someone who owed\nhim some money. They also mobilized some Arab tribes to contribute to the war\nagainst the Prophet [pbuh]. All the clans of Quraish gave their consent except Banu\n‘Adi. Soon an excited throng of 1300 soldiers including 100 horsemen and 600\nmailed soldiers with a large number of camels, was clamouring to proceed to fight\nthe Muslims. For food supplies, they used to slaughter an alternate number of camels\nof ten and nine every day. They were however afraid that Banu Bakr, on account of\nold long deep- seated animosity, would attack their rear. At that critical moment, \tIblis\n(Satan) appeared to them in the guise of Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju‘sham Al- Mudlaji —\nchief of Bani Kinana — saying to them: \"I guarantee that no harm will happen from\nbehind.\"\nThey set out burning with indignation, motivated by a horrible desire for revenge and\nexterminating anyone that might jeopardize the routes of their caravans:\n\"…boastfully and to be seen of men, and hinder (men) from the path of\nAllâh. \" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:47]\nOr as the Prophet [pbuh] said:\n\"O Allâh these are the haughty and conceited; they have come defying Allâh\nand defying His Messenger.\"\nThey moved swiftly northward to Badr. On the way they received another message\nfrom Abu Sufyan asking them to go back home because the caravan had escaped the\nMuslims. Incidentally, Abu Sufyan, on learning the intention of the Muslims, led his\ncaravan off the main route, and inclined it towards the Red Sea. By this manoeuvre,\nhe was able to slip past the Madinese ambush and was out of their reach.\nOn receiving Abu Sufyan’s message, the Makkan army showed a desire to return\nhome. The tyrant Abu Jahl, however haughtily and arrogantly insisted that they\nproceed to Badr, stay three nights there for making festivities. Now they wanted to\npunish the Muslims and prevent them from intercepting their caravans, and impress\non the Arabs that Quraish still had the upper hand and enjoyed supremacy in that\narea.\nAbu Jahl’s threats and insistence notwithstanding, Banu Zahrah, acting on the advice\nof Al- Akhnas bin Shuraiq, broke away and returned to Makkah. Thenceforth Al-\nAkhnas remained ‘the well- rubbed palm tree’ for Bani Zahrah and was blindly obeyed\nin all relevant matters.\nBanu Hashim were also inclined to break away, but Abu Jahl’s threats made them\ndesist from that idea.\n\n-- 133 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n134\nThe rest of the army, now 1000 soldiers, approached Badr and encamped\nthemselves beyond a sand dune at Al- ‘Udwat Al- Quswa.\n‘The intelligence corps’ of the Madinese army reported to the Prophet [pbuh] that a\nbloody encounter with the Makkans was inescapable, and that a daring step in this\ncontext had to be taken, or else the forces of evil would violate the inviolable and\nwould consequently manage to undermine the noble cause of the Islam and tread\nupon its faithful adherents. The Muslims were afraid that the pagan Makkans would\nmarch on and start the war activities within the headquarters of Islam, Madinah. A\nmove of such nature would certainly damage and produce an infamous impact on the\ndignity and stance of the Muslims.\nOn account of the new grave developments, the Prophet [pbuh] held an advisory\nmilitary emergency meeting to review the ongoing situation and exchange\nviewpoints with the army leaders. Admittedly, some Muslims feared the horrible\nencounter and their courage began to waver; in this regard, Allâh says:\n\"As your Lord caused you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) to go out from your home\nwith the Truth, and verily, a party among the believers disliked it, disputing\nwith you concerning the Truth after it was made manifest, as if they were\nbeing driven to death while they were looking (at it).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:5, 6]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] apprised his men of the gravity of the situation and asked for\ntheir advice. Abu Bakr was the first who spoke on the occasion and assured the\nProphet [pbuh] of the unreserved obedience to his command. ‘Umar was the next to\nstand up and supported the views expressed by his noble friend. Then Al- Miqdad bin\n‘Amr got up and said: \"O Messenger of Allâh! Proceed where Allâh directs you to, for\nwe are with you. We will not say as the Children of Israel said to Moses [AWS]:\n\"Go you and your Lord and fight and we will stay here;\"\nRather we shall say:\n\"Go you and your Lord and fight and we will fight along with you.\"\nBy Allâh! If you were to take us to Bark Al- Ghimad, we will still fight resolutely with\nyou against its defenders until you gained it.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] thanked him and blessed him.\nThe three leaders who spoke were from the Emigrants, who only constituted a minor\nsection of the army. The Prophet [pbuh] wanted, and for the more reason, to hear\nthe Helpers’ view because they were the majority of the soldiers and were expected\nto shoulder the brunt of the war activities. Moreover, the clauses of Al- ‘Aqabah\nPledge did not commit them to fighting beyond their territories.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] then said:\n\"Advise me my men!\"\n\n-- 134 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n135\nby which he meant the Helpers, in particular. Upon this Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh stood up and\nsaid: \"By Allâh, I feel you want us (the Helpers) to speak.\" The Prophet [pbuh]\ndirectly said: \"Oh, yes!\" Sa‘d said: \"O Prophet of Allâh! We believe in you and we\nbear witness to what you have vouchsafed to us and we declare in unequivocal terms\nthat what you have brought is the Truth. We give you our firm pledge of obedience\nand sacrifice. We will obey you most willingly in whatever you command us, and by\nAllâh, Who has sent you with the Truth, if you were to ask us to plunge into the sea,\nwe will do that most readily and not a man of us will stay behind. We do not grudge\nthe idea of encounter with the enemy. We are experienced in war and we are\ntrustworthy in combat. We hope that Allâh will show you through our hands those\ndeeds of valour which will please your eyes. Kindly lead us to the battlefield in the\nName of Allâh.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was impressed with the fidelity and the spirit of sacrifice which\nhis companions showed at this critical juncture. Then he said to them: \"Forward and\nbe of cheer, for Allâh has promised me one of the two (the lucrative course through\ncapturing the booty or strife in the cause of Allâh against the polytheists), and by\nAllâh it is as if I now saw the enemy lying prostrate.\"\nIn the immediate vicinity of Badr, the Prophet [pbuh] and his cavemate Abu Bakr\nconducted a scouting operation during which they managed to locate the camp of\nQuraish. They came across an old bedouin nearby whom they manipulated and\nmanaged to extract from him the exact location of the army of the polytheists. In the\nevening of the same day, he despatched three Emigrant leaders, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib,\nAz- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam and Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas to scout about for news about the\nenemy. They saw two men drawing water for the Makkan army. On interrogation,\nthey admitted that they were water carriers working for Quraish. But that answer did\nnot please some Muslims and they beat the two boys severely in order to exact from\nthem an answer, even if it isn’t true, alluding to the caravan laden with wealth. The\ntwo boys thus lied, and so they were released. The Prophet [pbuh] was angry with\nthose men and censured them saying: \"On telling the truth, you beat them, and on\ntelling a lie, you released them!\" He then addressed the two boys and after a little\nconversation with them he learned a lot about the enemy: number of soldiers, their\nexact location and names of some of their notables.\nHe then turned to the Muslims and said: \"Hearken, Quraish has sent you their most\nprecious lives.\"\nThe same night it rained on both sides. For the polytheists it obstructed further\nprogress, whereas it was a blessing for the Muslims. It cleaned them and removed\nfrom them the stain of Satan. Allâh sent rain to strengthen their hearts and to plant\ntheir feet firmly therewith. They marched a little forward and encamped at the\nfarther bank of the valley. Muhammad [pbuh] stopped at the nearest spring of Badr.\nAl- Hubab bin Mundhir asked him, \"Has Allâh inspired you to choose this very spot or\nis it stratagem of war and the product of consultation?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied\n\"It is stratagem of war and consultation.\" Al- Hubab said: \"This place is no good; let\nus go and encamp on the nearest water well and make a basin or reservoir full of\nwater, then destroy all the other wells so that they will be deprived of the water.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] approved of his plan and agreed to carry it out, which they\nactually did at midnight.\n\n-- 135 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n136\nSa‘d bin Mu‘adh suggested that a trellis be built for the Prophet [pbuh] to function as\nheadquarters for the Muslim army and a place providing reasonable protection for\nthe leader. Sa‘d began to justify his proposal and said that if they had been\nvictorious, then everything would be satisfactory. In case of defeat, the Prophet\n[pbuh] would not be harmed and he could go back to Madinah where there were\nmore people who loved him and who would have come for help if they had known\nthat he was in that difficult situation, so that he would resume his job, hold counsel\nwith them and they would strive in the cause of Allâh with him again and again.\nA squad of guards was also chosen from amongst the Helpers under the leadership\nof the same man, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, in order to defend the Prophet [pbuh] in his\nheadquarters.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] spent the whole night preceding the day of the battle in prayer\nand supplication. The Muslim army, wearied with their long march, enjoyed sound\nand refreshing sleep, a mark of the Divine favour and of the state of their\nundisturbed minds.\n\"(Remember) when He covered you with a slumber as a security from Him,\nand He caused rain to descend on you from the sky, to clean you thereby\na nd to remove from you the \tRijz \t(whispering, evil suggestions, etc.) of\nSatan, and to strengthen your hearts, and make your feet firm thereby.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 8:11]\nThat was Friday night, Ramadan 17th., the year 2 A.H.\nIn the morning, the Prophet [pbuh] called his men to offer the prayers and then\nurged them to fight in the way of Allâh. As the sun rose over the desert, the Prophet\n[pbuh] drew up his little army, and pointing with an arrow which he held in his hand,\narranged the ranks.\nQuraish, on the other hand, positioned their forces in Al- ‘Udwat Al- Quswa opposite\nthe Muslim lines. A few of them approached, in a provocative deed, to draw water\nfrom the wells of Badr, but were all shot dead except one, Hakeem bin Hizam, who\nlater became a devoted Muslim. ‘Umair bin Wahab Al- Jumahi, in an attempt to\nreconnoiter the power of the Muslims, made a scouting errand and submitted a\nreport saying that the Muslim army numbered as many as 300 men keen on fighting\nto the last man. On another reconnaissance mission he came to the conclusion that\nneither reinforcements were coming nor ambushes laid. He understood that they\nwere too brave to surrender and too intent on carrying out their military duties to\nwithdraw without slaying the largest number possible of the polytheists. This report\nas well as kindred relations binding the two belligerent parties together, slackened\nthe desire to fight among some of the Quraishites. To counteract this reason- based\nopposition advocated by a rival of his, ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a and others, Abu Jahl started\nan anti- campaign seeking vengeance on Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers for the\nQuraishites killed at Nakhlah. In this way, he managed to thwart the opposite\norientation, and manipulated the people to see his evil views only.\nWhen the two parties approached closer and were visible to each other, the Prophet\n[pbuh] began supplicatin",
  "g Allâh \"O Allâh! The conceited and haughty Quraishites are\nalready here defying You and belying Your Messenger. O Allâh! I am waiting for Your\nvictory which You have promised me. I beseech You Allâh to defeat them (the\n\n-- 136 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n137\nenemies).\" He also gave strict orders that his men would not start fighting until he\ngave them his final word. He recommended that they use their arrows sparingly \t[Sahih\nAl- Bukhari 2/568] \tand never resort to sword unless the enemies came too close. [Abu Da'ud\n2/13]\nAbu Jahl also prayed for victory, saying: \"Our Lord, whichever of the two parties was\nless kind to his relatives, and brought us what we do not know, then destroy him\ntomorrow.\". They were confident that their superior number, equipment and\nexperience would be decisive. The Noble Qur’ân, with a play on the word, told them\nthat the decision had come, and the victory — but not in the sense they had hoped\nfor:\n\"(O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come\nunto you and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you, and if you\nreturn (to the attack), so shall we return, and your forces will be of no avail\nto you, however numerous it be, and verily, Allâh is with the believers.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 8:19]\nThe first disbeliever to trigger the fire of the battle and be its first victim was Al-\nAswad bin ‘Abdul Asad Al- Makhzumi, a fierce bad- tempered idolater. He stepped out\nswearing he would drink from the water basin of the Muslims, otherwise, destroy it\nor die for it. He engaged with Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, who struck his leg with his\nsword and dealt him another blow that finished him off inside the basin.\nThe battle had actually started. Protected by armour and shields, ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a\nstepped forth between his brother Shaibah and his son Al- Waleed bin ‘Utbah from\nthe lines of Quraish and hurled maledictions at the Muslims. Three young men of the\nHelpers came out against them: ‘Awf and Mu‘wwadh — the sons of Harith, and\n‘Abdullah bin Rawaha. But the Makkans yelled that they had nothing to do with\nthem. They wanted the heads of their cousins. Upon this the Prophet [pbuh] asked\n‘Ubaidah bin Al- Harith, Hamzah — his uncle, and his cousin ‘Ali [R] to go forward for\nthe combat. The three duels were rapid. Hamzah killed Shaibah, while ‘Ali killed Al-\nWaleed. [Mishkat 2/343] \t‘Ubaidah was seriously wounded but, before he fell, Hamzah fell\nupon ‘Utbah and with a sweep of his sword, cut off his head. ‘Ali and Hamzah carried\n‘Ubaidah back with his leg cut off. He died four or five days later of a disease in the\nbile duct.\n‘Ali was possessed of a deep conviction that Allâh’s Words were revealed:\n\"These two opponents (believers and disbelievers) dispute with each other\nabout their Lord.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 22:19]\nThese verses were revealed in connection with men of Faith who confess their Lord\nand seek to carry out His Will (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers at Badr Battle),\nand men who deny their Lord and defy Him (the people of Quraish).\nThe duel was followed by a few more duels but the Makkans suffered terrible defeats\nin all the combats and lost some of their most precious lives. They were too much\nexasperated and enraged and fell upon the Muslims to exterminate them once and\nfor all. The Muslims, however, after supplicating their Lord, calling upon Him for\nassistance, were made to hold to their position and conduct a defensive war plan\nthat was successful enough to inflict heavy losses on the attackers. The Prophet\n\n-- 137 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n138\n[pbuh] used to pray to his Lord ceaselessly persistently and day and night to come to\ntheir succour. When the fierce engagement grew too hot he again began to\nsupplicate his Lord saying:\n\"O Allâh! Should this group (of Muslims) be defeated today, You will no\nlonger be worshipped.\"\nHe continued to call out to his Lord, stretching forth his hands and facing \tAl- Qiblah,\nuntil his cloak fell off his shoulders. Then Abu Bakr came, picked up the cloak, and\nput it back on his shoulders and said: \"O Prophet of Allâh, you have cried out enough\nto your Lord. He will surely fulfill what He has promised you.\"\nImmediate was the response from Allâh, Who sent down angels from the heavens for\nthe help and assistance of the Prophet [pbuh] and his companions. The Noble Qur’ân\nobserves:\n\"Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast\nterror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:12]\nAllâh, the All- Mighty, also inspired another message to His Messenger, saying:\n\"I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other\n(following one another) in succession.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:9]\nThe Prophet [pbuh], in his trellis, dozed off a little and then raised his head joyfully\ncrying:\n\"O Abu Bakr, glad tidings are there for you: Allâh’s victory has approached,\nby Allâh, I can see Gabriel on his mare in the thick of a sandstorm.\"\nHe then jumped out crying:\n\"Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 54:45]\nAt the instance of Gabriel, the Prophet [pbuh] took a handful of gravel, cast it at the\nenemy and said: \"Confusion seize their faces!\" As he flung the dust, a violent\nsandstorm blew like furnace blast into the eyes of the enemies. With respect to this,\nAllâh says:\n\"And you (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]) threw not when you did throw but Allâh\nthrew.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:17]\nOnly then did he give clear orders to launch a counter- attack. He was commanding\nthe army, inspiring confidence among his men and exhorting them to fight manfully\nfor the sake of their Lord, reciting the Words of Allâh:\n\"And be quick for forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as\nare the heavens and the earth.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:133]\n\n-- 138 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n139\nThe spirit he infused into his men was clearly witnessed by the valour of ‘Umair, a\nlad of sixteen, who flung away some dates he was eating crying out: \"These (the\ndates) are holding me back from Paradise.\" So saying he plunged into the thick of\nthe battle and died fighting bravely. Unique deeds of valour, deep devotion and full\nobedience to the Prophet [pbuh] were exhibited in the process of the battle. The\narmy of the faithfuls was borne forward by the power of enthusiasm which the half-\nhearted warriors of Makkah miserably lacked. A large number of the polytheists were\nkilled and the others began to waver. No wonder! The standard- bearers of Truth\nwere given immediate help, and supernatural agencies (the angels), were sent to\ntheir assistance by their Lord to help them defeat the forces of evil.\nThe records of \tHadith \tspeak eloquently of the fact that the angels did appear on that\nday and fought on the side of the Muslims. Ibn ‘Abbas said: \"While on that day a\nMuslim was chasing a disbeliever and he heard over him the swashing of a whip and\nthe voice of the rider saying: ‘Go ahead Haizum’. He glanced at the polytheist who\nhad (now) fallen down on his back. The Helper came to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] and related that event to him. The Prophet [pbuh] replied: ‘You have told the\ntruth. This was the help from the third heaven.\" [Sahih Muslim 2/93]\nOne of the Helpers captured ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, who said: \"O Messenger of\nAllâh, by Allâh this man did not capture me. I was captured by a man who was bald\nand had the most handsome face, and who was riding a piebald horse, I cannot see\nhim here among the people.\" The Helper interrupted: \"I captured him, O Messenger\nof Allâh.\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied:\n\"Be quiet, Allâh the All- Mighty strengthened you with the help of a noble\nangel.\"\nIblîs, the archsatan, in the guise of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju‘sham Al- Mudlaji, on\nseeing angels working in favour of the Muslims, and Quraish rapidly losing ground on\nthe battlefield, made a quick retreat despite the polytheists’ pleas to stay on. He ran\noff and plunged into the sea.\nThe ranks of Quraish began to give way and their numbers added nothing but\nconfusion. The Muslims followed eagerly their retreating steps, slaying or taking\ncaptive all that fell within their reach. Retreat soon turned into ignominious rout; and\nthey flied in haste, casting away their armour, abandoned beasts of burden, camp\nand equipage.\nThe great tyrant Abu Jahl, however, on seeing the adverse course of the battle, tried\nto stop the tidal wave of the Islamic victory by nerving the polytheists and\nencouraging them by all means available and adjuring them by Al- Lat and ‘Uzza and\nall symbols of paganism to stand firm in place and retaliate against the Muslims, but\nto no avail. Their morale had already been drastically reduced to zero, and their lines\nbroken down. He then began to realize the reality of his arrogance and haughtiness.\nNone remained around him except a gang of doomed polytheists whose resistance\nwas also quelled by an Islamic irresistible storm of true devotion- based valour and\nIslam- orientated pursuit of martyrdom. Abu Jahl was deserted and left by himself on\nhis horse waiting for death at the hand of two courageous lads of the Helpers.\n‘Abdur- Rahman bin ‘Awf related the following interesting story in this regard: I was\nin the thick of the battle when two youths, still seemingly inexperienced in the art of\n\n-- 139 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n140\nfighting, one on the right and the second on the left. One of them spoke in a secret\nvoice asking me to show him Abu Jahl. I asked about his intention, to which he\nreplied, that he had a strong desire to engage with him in a combat until either of\nthem was killed. It was something incredible to me. I turned left and the other said\nsomething to the same effect and showed a similar desire. I acceded to their earnest\npleas and pointed directly at their target. They both rushed swiftly towards the spot,\nand without a moment’s hesitation struck him simultaneously with their swords and\nfinished him off. They went back to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], each claiming\nthat he had killed Abu Jahl to the exclusion of the other. The Prophet [pbuh] asked if\nthey had wiped the blood off their swords and they answered that they had not. He\nthen examined both swords and assured them that they both had killed him. When\nthe battle concluded, Abu Jahl’s spoils were given to Mu‘adh bin ‘Amr bin Al- Jumuh,\nbecause the other Mu‘awwadh bin Al- ‘Afrâ’ [Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/444,2/568; Mishkat 2/352] \twas\nlater killed in the course of the same battle. At the termination of the battle, the\nProphet [pbuh] wanted to look for this archenemy of Islam, Abu Jahl. ‘Abdullah bin\nMas‘ud found him on the verge of death breathing his last. He stepped on his neck\naddressing him: \"Have you seen how Allâh has disgraced you?\" The enemy of Islam\nstill defiantly answered: \"I am not disgraced. I am no more than a man killed by his\nown people on the battlefield.\" And then inquired \"Who has won the battle?\" Ibn\nMas‘ud replied \"Allâh and His Messenger.\" Abu Jahl then said with a heart full of\ngrudge \"You have followed difficult ways, you shepherd!\" Ibn Mas‘ud used to be a\nshepherd working for the Makkan aristocrats.\nIbn Mas‘ud then cut off his head and took it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who,\non seeing it, began to entertain Allâh’s praise:\n\"Allâh is Great, praise is to Allâh, Who has fulfilled His Promise, assisted His\nservant and defeated the confederates alone.\"\nHe then set out to have a look at the corpse. There he said:\n\"This is the Pharaoh of this nation.\"\nSome Significant Instances of Devotion\n1. \tThe Prophet [pbuh] advised his companions to preserve the lives of Banu\nHashim who had gone out to Badr with the polytheists unwillingly because\nthey had feared the censure of their people. Among them, he named Al-\n‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and Abu Bukhtari bin Hisham. He ordered the\nMuslims to capture, but not to kill them. Abu Hudhaifah bin ‘Utbah showed\ngreat surprise and commented saying: \"We kill our fathers, children, brothers\nand members of our clan, and then come to spare Al- ‘Abbas? By Allâh! If I\nsee him I will surely strike him with my sword.\" On hearing these words, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], addressing ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, said \"Is it fair\nthat the face of the Messenger’s uncle be struck with sword?\" ‘Umar got\nindignant and threatened to kill Abu Hudhaifah; the latter later said that\nextreme fear had taken firm grip of him and felt that nothing except\nmartyrdom could expiate for his mistake. He was actually killed later on\nduring Al- Yamamah events.\n2. \tAbu Al- Bukhtari bin Hisham had already done his best to restrain his people,\nthe Makkans, from committing any act of folly against the Prophet [pbuh]\n\n-- 140 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n141\nwhile the latter was still in Makkah. He also neither hurt nor was reported to\nhave uttered anything repugnant with regard to the Prophet [pbuh]. He had\nas well been among the people who tried to invalidate the boycott alliance\ntaken against Banu Hashim and Banu ‘Abdul Muttalib.\nHere, however, in the battle of Badr he insisted on fighting unless his\ncompatriot was spared. Al- Mujdhir bin Ziyad Al- Balwi, with whom he was\nengaged in combat, replied that the other was not included in the Prophet\n[pbuh]’s recommendation. The combat went on to end in Al- Bukhtari’s death.\n3. \t‘Abdur- Rahman bin ‘Awf and Omaiyah bin Khalaf had been close friends\nduring the pre- Islamic era. When the battle of Badr ended, ‘Abdur- Rahman\nsaw Omaiyah and his son among the captives. He threw away the armour he\nhad as spoils, and walked with them both. Bilal, the Prophet [pbuh]’s caller\nfor prayer, saw Omaiyah and soon all the torture he had been put to at the\nhand of this man dawned upon him, and swore he would have revenge on\nOmaiyah. ‘Abdur- Rahman tried to ease the tension and address embarrassing\nsituation amicably but with no success. The Muslims gathered around and\nstruck Omaiyah’s son with swords. At this point, ‘Abdur- Rahman called upon\nhis old friend to run for his life but he was put to swords from different people\nand lay down dead. ‘Abdur- Rahman, completely helpless and resigned said:\nMay Allâh have mercy on Bilal, for he deprived me of the spoils, and I have\nbeen stricken by the death of my two captives.\n4. \tOn the moral level, the battle of Badr was an inescapable conflict between the\nforces of good and those of evil. In this context, ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab did not\nspare the life of any polytheist even his uncle on the maternal side Al- ‘As bin\nHisham bin Al- Mugheerah.\n5. \tAbu Bakr shouted at his son ‘Abdur- Rahman, still a polytheist and fighting\nwith them, \"Where is my wealth, you wicked boy?\" The son answered that it\nwas gone with the wind.\n6. \tWhen the battle ended, the Muslims began to hold some polytheists in\ncaptivity. The Prophet [pbuh] looked into the face of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, the\nHead of the Prophet [pbuh]’s guards, and understood that he was hateful to\ntaking the enemy elements as prisoners. Sa‘d agreed to what the Prophet\n[pbuh] said and added that it was the first victory for the Muslims over the\nforces of polytheism, and he had more liking for slaying them than sparing\ntheir lives.\n7. \tOn the day of Badr, the sword of ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan Al- Asdi broke down so\nthe Prophet [pbuh] gave him a log of wood which he shook and it\nimmediately turned into a long strong white sword. ‘Ukashah went on using\nthat same sword in most of the Islamic conquests until he died in the process\nof the apostasy wars.\n8. \tWhen the war activities had been concluded, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al- ‘Abdari saw\nhis brother, still a polytheist, being handcuffed by a Ansari. Mus‘ab\nrecommended that the Helper tighten the knot for the prisoner’s mother was\nwealthy enough to ransom her son. ‘Abu ‘Aziz, Mus‘ab’s brother, tried to\nappeal to his brother through the family ties, but the latter firmly replied that\nthe Helper was more eligible for brotherhood than him.\n9. \tWhen the Prophet [pbuh] ordered that the corpses of the polytheists be\ndropped into an empty well, Abu Hudhaifah bin ‘Utbah looked sadly at his\ndead father, who fought on the side of the polytheists. The Prophet [pbuh]\n\n-- 141 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n142\nnoticed that and asked him about it. Hudhaifah said that he had never held\nthe least doubt that his father met his fate deservedly, but added that he\nwished he had been guided to the path of Islam, and that is why he felt sad.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] whispered in his ears some comforting words.\nThe outcome of the battle was as aforementioned an ignominious rout for the\npolytheists and a manifest victory for the Muslims. Fourteen Muslims were killed, of\nwhom six were from the Emigrants and eight from the Helpers. The polytheists\nsustained heavy casualties, seventy were killed and a like number taken prisoners.\nMany of the principal men of Makkah, and some of Muhammad [pbuh]’s bitterest\nopponents, were among the slain. Chief of these was Abu Jahl.\nOn the third day, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] went out to look at the slain\npolytheists, and said:\n\"What an evil tribe you were as regards your Prophet, you belied me but the\nothers have believed; you let me down while the others have supported me;\nyou expelled me, whereas the others have sheltered me.\"\nHe stood over the bodies of twenty- four leaders of Quraish who had been thrown\ninto one of the wells, and started to call them by name and by the names of their\nfathers, saying: \"Would it not have been much better for you if you had obeyed Allâh\nand His Messenger? Behold, we have found that our Lord’s promise do come true;\ndid you (also) find that the promises of your Lord came true?\" Thereupon, ‘Umar bin\nAl- Khattab said: \"O Messenger of Allâh! Why you speak to bodies that have no souls\nin them?\" The Prophet [pbuh] answered: \"By Him in Whose hand is Muhammad\n[pbuh]’s soul! You do not hear better what I am saying than they do.\"\nReaction in Makkah\nThe polytheists having received a large dose of disciplining and heavy defeat, fled\naway in great disorder in the vales and hillocks heading for Makkah panicked and too\nashamed to see their people.\nIbn Ishaq related that the first herald of bad tidings was Al- Haisaman bin ‘Abdullah\nAl- Khuza‘i. He narrated to them how their notables were killed. People there did not\nbelieve him at first and thought that he had gone mad, but soon the news was\nconfirmed and a state of incredible bewilderment overwhelmed the whole Makkan\nscene. Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith gave Abu Lahab a full account of the massacre and\nthe disgraceful rout they sustained, with emphasis on the role that the angels played\nin bringing about their tragic end. Abu Lahab could not contain himself and gave vent\nto his feelings of resentment in beating, abusing and slapping Abu Rafi‘, a Muslim,\nbut reticent on his conversion, for reiterating the role of the angels. Umm Al- Fadl,\nanother Muslim woman, greatly exasperated by Abu Lahab’s thoughtless behaviour,\nstruck him with a log and cracked his head. Seven days later, he died of an ominous\nulcer and was left for three days unburied. His sons, however, for fear of shameful\nrumours, drove him to a pit and keeping their distance, hurled stones and dust at\nhim.\nThe defeat was a matter of great shame and grief for the Makkans. In almost every\nhouse there were silent tears for the dead and the captives. They were burning with\n\n-- 142 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n143\nhumiliation and were thirsting for revenge. Wailing, lamenting and crying however\nwere decreed strictly forbidden lest the Muslims should rejoice at their affliction.\nMadinah receives the News of Victory\nTwo heralds, ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah and Zaid bin Harithah were despatched to\nMadinah, to convey the glad tidings of victory to the Muslims there.\nThe multi- ethnic and ideological structure of Madinah featured different respective\nreactions. Rumour- mongers amongst the Jews and hypocrites spread news to the\neffect that the Prophet [pbuh] had been killed, and tried to impress their false\nassumption on the fact that Zaid bin Harithah was riding Al- Qaswâ’, the Prophet\n[pbuh]’s she- camel. Having reached, the two messengers imparted to the Muslims\nthe happy news of victory, and furnished accurate information about the course of\nevents in order to establish the sense of reassurance deep in the hearts of the\nanxious, but now, joyous Muslims. They immediately started acclaiming Allâh’s Name\nand entertaining His praise at the top of their voices. Their chiefs went out of the city\nto wait and receive the Prophet [pbuh] on the road leading to Badr.\nUsamah bin Zaid related that they received the news of the manifest victory shortly\nafter Ruqaiyah, the Prophet [pbuh]’s daughter, and the wife of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan\nhad been committed to earth. She had been terminally ill and the Prophet [pbuh]\nhad asked ‘Uthman to stay in Madinah and look after her.\nBefore leaving the scene of the battle, dispute concerning the spoils of war arose\namong the Muslim warriors, as the rule relating to their distribution had not yet been\nlegislated. When the difference grew wider, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nsuspended any solution whereof until the Revelation was sent down.\n‘Ubadah bin As- Samit said: \"We went out with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and I\nwitnessed Badr with him. The battle started and Allâh, the Exalted, defeated the\nenemy. Some of the Muslims sought and pursued the enemy, some were intent on\ncollecting the spoils from the enemy camp, and others were guarding the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] and were on the alert for any emergency or surprise attack. When\nnight came and the Muslims gathered together, those who had collected the booty\nsaid: \"We collected it, so no one else has any right to it.\" Those who had pursued the\nenemy said: \"You do not have more right to it than we do; we held the enemy at bay\nand then defeated them.\" As for the men who had been guarding the Prophet\n[pbuh], they also made similar claims to the spoils.\nAt that very time, a Qur’ânic verse was revealed saying:\n\"They ask you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) about the spoils of war. Say: ‘The\nspoils are for Allâh and the Messenger.’ So fear Allâh and adjust all matters\nof difference among you, and obey Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad\n[pbuh]), if you are believers.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:1]\nOn their way back to Madinah, at a large sand hill, the Prophet [pbuh] divided the\nspoils equally among the fighters after he had taken \tAl- Khums \t(one- fifth). When\nthey reached As- Safra’, he ordered that two of the prisoners should be killed. They\nwere An- Nadr bin Al- Harith and ‘Uqbah bin Abi Muait, because they had persecuted\n\n-- 143 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n144\nthe Muslims in Makkah, and harboured deep hatred towards Allâh and His Messenger\n[pbuh]. In a nutshell, they were criminals of war in modern terminology, and their\nexecution was an awesome lesson to oppressors. ‘Uqbah forgot his pride and cried\nout, \"Who will look after my children O Messenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh]\nanswered, \"The fire (of Hell). [Sunan Abu Da'ud with 'Aun- ul- Ma'bood 3/12] \" Did ‘Uqbah not\nremember the day when he had thrown the entrails of a sheep onto the head of the\nProphet [pbuh] while he was prostrating himself in prayer, and Fatimah had come\nand washed it off him? He had also strangled the Prophet [pbuh] with his cloak if it\nhad not been for Abu Bakr to intervene and release the Prophet [pbuh]. The heads of\nboth criminals were struck off by ‘Ali bin Abi Talib.\nAt Ar- Rawhâ’, a suburb of Madinah, the Muslim army was received by the joyous\nMadinese who had come to congratulate the Prophet [pbuh] on the manifest victory\nthat Allâh had granted him. Usaid bin Hudair, acting as a mouthpiece of the other\ntrue believers, after entertaining Allâh’s praise, he excused himself for not having\njoined them on grounds that the Prophet [pbuh]’s intention was presumably, an\nerrand aiming to intercept a caravan of camels only, he added that if it had occurred\nto him that it would be real war, he would have never tarried. The Prophet [pbuh]\nassured Usaid that he had believed him.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] now entered Madinah as a man to be counted for in a new\ndimension — the military field. In consequence, a large number of the people of\nMadinah embraced Islam, which added a lot to the strength, power and moral\nstanding of the true religion.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an\nextent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part\nof the meal) and keep the dates for themselves.\nPrisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new\nphenomenon in the history of Islam. The Prophet [pbuh] consulted Abu Bakr and\n‘Umar bin Al- Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr\nsuggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: \"They are after all\nour relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers,\nmoreover, Allâh could guide them to Islam.\" ‘Umar advised killing them, saying,\n\"They are the leaders of \tKufr \t(disbelief).\" The Prophet [pbuh] preferred Abu Bakr’s\nsuggestion to that of ‘Umar’s. The following day, ‘Umar called on the Prophet [pbuh]\nand Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired\nabout the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he\nwould feign weeping.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] said that a Qur’ânic verse had been revealed rebuking them for\ntaking ransom from the captives rather than slaying them:\n\"It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them\nwith ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in\nthe land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for\nfreeing the captives), but Allâh desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allâh is\nAll- Mighty, All- Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allâh, a severe\ntorment would have touched you for what you took.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:67,68]\nThe previous Divine ordainment went as follows,\n\n-- 144 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n145\n\"Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without\nransom) or ransom.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 47:4]\nWhich included an area providing permission to take ransom, that is why no penalty\nwas imposed. They were rebuked only for taking prisoners before subduing all the\nland of disbelief. Apart from this, the polytheists taken to Madinah were not only\nprisoners of war but rather archcriminals of war whom modern war penal law brings\nto justice to receive their due sentence of death or prison for life.\nThe ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams \tin accordance\nwith the captive’s financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an\neducational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and\nso each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to\nteach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient\nenough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released\nunransomed on grounds of being hard up. Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet\n[pbuh], paid the ransom of her husband Abul- ‘As with a necklace. The Muslims\nreleased her prisoner and returned the necklace in deference to the Prophet [pbuh]\nbut on condition that Abul- ‘As allow Zainab to migrate to Madinah, which he actually\ndid.\nIn captivity, there was also an eloquent orator called Suhail bin ‘Amr. ‘Umar\nsuggested that they pull out his front teeth to disable him from speaking, but the\nProphet [pbuh] turned down his suggestion for fear Quraish should retaliate in the\nsame manner on one hand, and on the other for fear of Allâh’s wrath on the Day of\nResurrection.\nSa‘d bin An- Nu‘man, a lesser pilgrim detained in Makkah, was released in return for\nsetting Abu Sufyan’s son, a captive, free.\nThe Battle of Badr in its Qur’ânic Context\nThe Chapter of \tAl- Anfal \t(spoils of war) was revealed on the occasion of the battle of\nBadr, Ramadan 17th 2 A.H. It constituted a unique Divine commentary on this\nbattle.\nAllâh, the All- High, in the context of this Chapter draws on major issues relating to\nthe whole process of Islamization. Allâh, here draws the attention of the Muslims to\nthe still lingering moral shortcomings in their character. He wants them to build an\nintegrated, purified society. He speaks about the invisible assistance he sent down to\nHis obedient servants to enable them to accomplish their noble objectives. He wants\nthe Muslims to rid themselves of any trait of haughtiness or arrogance that might\nsneak in. He wants them to turn to Him for help, obey Him and His Messenger\n[pbuh].\nAfter that He delineated the noble objectives for which the Messenger [pbuh]\nlaunched that bloody battle, and directed them to the merits and qualities that\nbrought about the great victory.\nThe polytheists, hypocrites, the Jews and prisoners of war were also mentioned,\nbeing admonished to surrender to the Truth and adhere to it only.\n\n-- 145 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n146\nThe question of the spoils of war was resolved and the principles and basics relevant\nto this issue were clearly defined.\nThe laws and rules pertinent to war and peace were legalized and codified, especially\nat this advanced stage of the Islamic action. Allâh wanted the Muslims to follow war\nethics dissimilar to those of pre- Islamic practices. The Muslims are deemed to outdo\nthe others in ethics, values and fine ideals. He wants to impress on the world that\nIslam is not merely a theoretical code of life, it is rather mind cultivation- orientated\npractical principles. In this context, He established inter and intra- state relations.\nThe fast of Ramadan was established as an obligatory observance in the year 2 A.H.,\nappended by the duty imposed upon Muslims of paying \tZakat \t(alms tax, poor- due) in\norder to alleviate the burden of the needy Emigrants.\nA wonderful and striking coincidence was the establishment of Shawwal \t‘Eid \t(the\nFestival of the Fast- Breaking) directly after the manifest victory of Badr. It was\nactually the finest spectacle ever witnessed of Muslims leaving their houses praying,\nacclaiming Allâh’s N",
  "ame and entertaining His praise at the top of their voices in\nrecognition of His favour and grace, and last but not least, the support He rendered\nthem and through which the forces of the Truth overpowered those of evil.\n\"And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land,\nand were afraid that men might kidnap you, but He provided a safe place for\nyou, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so\nthat you might be grateful.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:26]\n\n-- 146 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n147\nThe Military Activities between Badr and Uhud\nThe battle of Badr was the first armed encounter between the Muslims and Quraish.\nIt was in fact a decisive battle that gained the Muslims a historic victory\nacknowledged by all the Arabs, and dealt a heavy blow to the religious and economic\ninterests of the polytheists. There were also the Jews who also used to regard each\nIslamic victory as a heavy blow to their religioeconomic entity. Both parties were\nburning with rage and fury since the Muslims had achieved that great victory:\n\"Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers\n(Muslims) the Jews and \tAl- Mushrikûn \t(polytheists, pagans, idolators and\ndisbelievers, etc.).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 5:82]\nBoth resentful parties had their much more indignant suite in the form of hypocrites\nwho faked Islam just to save their faces; at the head of whom came ‘Abdullah bin\nUbai and his retinue. The desert bedouins living in tents pitched in the vicinity of\nMadinah, who depended on plundering and looting as a means of living, were totally\nindifferent to this axial question of belief and disbelief. Their worry derived from fear\nof losing their perverted avenues of subsistence in case a powerful nascent Muslim\nstate should rise up and put an end to such ill- practices, hence the grudge they\nnursed against Islam and the Muslims, in general, and the person of Muhammad\n[pbuh], in particular.\nThe whole cause of Faith was thus at stake with four furious parties laying ambushes\nagainst the new religion, each in its style: Pretension to Islam embedded with\nconspiracy plots and provocative deeds within Madinah, explicitly uncovered\nanimosity pregnant with indignation and fire of rage on the part of the Jews, and\nthere in Makkah open and persistent calls for vengeance coupled with open\nintentions to mobilize all potential resources available to silence the voice of Islam\nonce and for all. This was later translated into military action, Uhud Invasion, which\nleft a very bad impression on the good name and esteem that the Muslims were\npainstakingly working to merit and preserve.\nThe Muslims were always obliged to be on the lookout for any hostile movements,\nand it was imperative on them to launch pre- emptive strikes in all directions in order\nto enjoy a reasonable degree of security in this great instability- provoking ocean of\nunrest. The following is a list of military activities conducted in the post- Badr era:\nAl-Kudr Invasion\nThe scouting body of Madinah reported that Banu Saleem of Ghatafan were engaged\nin mustering troops to invade the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] took the initiative\nhimself and mounted a surprise attack on them in their own homeland at a watering\nplace called Al- Kudr. Banu Saleem, on receiving the news, had fled before he\narrived. He stayed there for three days, took their 500 camels as booty and\ndistributed them to the fighters after he had set aside the usual one- fifth; each one\ngained two camels.\nThis invasion took place in Shawwal in the year 2 A.H., seven days after the event of\nBadr. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/90; Ibn Hisham 2/43,44; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.236]\n\n-- 147 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n148\nAn Attempt on the Life of the Prophet [pbuh]\nThe impact of defeat at Badr was so great that the Makkans began to burn with\nindignation and resentment over their horrible losses. To resolve this situation two\npolytheists volunteered to quench their thirst and muffle the source of that\nhumiliation i.e. the Prophet [pbuh].\n‘Umair bin Wahab Al- Jumahi, a terrible polytheist, and an archenemy Safwan bin\nOmaiyah sat together privately lamenting their loss and remembering their dead and\ncaptives. ‘Umair expressed a fervent desire to kill the Prophet [pbuh] and release his\ncaptured son in Madinah, if it was not for the yoke of debts he was under and the\nlarge family he had to support. Safwan, also had his good reasons to see the Prophet\n[pbuh] killed, so he offered to discharge ‘Umair’s debts and support his family if he\nwent on with his plan.\n‘Umair agreed and asked Safwan to be reticent on the whole scheme. He left for\nMadinah, having with him a sword to which he applied some kind of lethal poison.\n‘Umar bin Al- Khattab saw him at the door of the Mosque and understood that he had\ncome with evil intentions. He immediately went into the Mosque and informed the\nProphet [pbuh]. He was let in looped by the sling of his sword and in greeting he said\n\"good morning\", to which the Prophet [pbuh] replied that Allâh had been Gracious\nand taught them the greeting of the dwellers of the Paradise: \"peace be upon you!\"\nTo a question raised by the Prophet [pbuh], about his object, ‘Umair said that he had\ncome to see that his captured son was well treated. As for the sword, which the\nProphet [pbuh] asked him about, he cursed it and said that it gained them nothing.\nOn exhorting him to tell his real goal, he remained obdurate and did not divulge the\nsecret meeting with Safwan. Here the Prophet [pbuh] got impatient and he himself\nrevealed to ‘Umair his secret mission. ‘Umair was taken by surprise, and incredible\nastonishment seized him, and immediately bore witness to the Messengership of\nMuhammad [pbuh]. He then began to entertain Allâh’s praise for having been guided\nto the ‘Straight Path’. The Prophet [pbuh] was pleased and asked his Companions to\nteach ‘Umair the principles of Islam, recite to him the Noble Qur’ân and release his\nson from captivity.\nSafwan, meanwhile, was still entertaining false illusions as to the approaching\nredemption of honour, and burying the memory of Badr into oblivion. He was\nimpatiently awaiting ‘Umair’s news but to his great surprise, he was told that the\nman had embraced Islam and changed into a devoted believer. ‘Umair later came\nback to Makkah where he started to call people unto Islam and he did actually\nmanage to convert a lot of Makkans into Islam. [Ibn Hisham 1/661-663]\nInvasion of Bani Qainuqa‘\nWe have already spoken about the treaty that the Prophet [pbuh] signed with the\nJews. He was very careful to abide by it to the letter and the Muslims did not show\nthe least violation of any of its provisions. The Jews, however, whose natural\ndisposition is closely linked to treachery, betrayal and covenant- breaching, could not\nrid themselves of the tradition of theirs, and started a process of intrigues and\ntroublemaking with the aim of producing schism in the growing solid Muslim ranks.\nHere is a relevant model of their behaviour: Shas bin Qais, an elderly Jew, a terrible\ndisbeliever and a greatly envious man of the Muslims, passed by a group of\n\n-- 148 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n149\nMuhammad [pbuh]’s followers of Aws and Khazraj. He perceived a prevalent spirit of\nreconciliation and an atmosphere of rapport and amity enveloping the whole group;\nan unusual scene categorically in conflict with the animosity and hatred that\ncharacterized their pre- Islam behaviour. He, therefore, sent a youth of his to sit\namong them, remind them of Bu‘ath war between them and recite some of their\nverses which they used to compose satirizing each other; all of this with the\nintention of sowing the seeds of discord and disagreement and undermining the new\nIslamically- orientated inter- tribal relations. The youth did in fact succeed and the two\nparties at no time recalled the old days and pre- Islam tribal fanaticism sprang to the\nfront to bring about a state of war.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was reported of this account, and immediately, at the head of\nsome Emigrants, set out to see to the situation. He began to rebuke them but in the\nmanner of the great instructor and the tolerant spirit of the understanding guide: \"O,\nMuslims! Do you still advance pre- Islamic arguments after I have been sent to you\n(as a Messenger). Remember that it is not rightful for you to turn backward after\nAllâh has guided you to the Straight Path, delivered you from disbelief and created\namity between you.\" The Muslims readily realized that it was a Satanic whim and a\nplot hatched by the enemies. They directly embraced each other and went back\nhome quite satisfied and in full obedience to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. [Ibn Hisham\n1/555, 556]\nSuch were the practices of the Jews, trouble- making, dissension- sowing, falsehood-\nfabrication, faking belief in the day, and practising disbelief at night. In everyday life,\nthey used to tighten the ropes of financial dealings on the Muslims. If they happened\nto owe a Muslim something, they would shirk their obligations on grounds that he\nhad converted into a new religion and they would allege the basis of agreement was\nno longer valid. If it was the other way, they would never cease to harass him day\nand night to pay back the debt, all of which in a desperate attempt to demolish the\ngreat edifice of the new religion that was rapidly gaining ground and speedily\ntowering up skyward.\nThe Qainuqa‘ Jews breach the Covenant\nSeeing that Allâh sided with the believers and granted them a manifest victory and\nperceiving the Muslims’ awesome presence in Madinah, the Jews could no longer\ncontain themselves or conceal indignation. They started a series of provocative and\nharmful deeds publicly. The most wicked amongst them were the tribe of Banu\nQainuqa‘, who lived in quarters within Madinah named after them. As for jobs, they\ntook up goldsmithery, blacksmithing and crafts of making household instruments,\nthat is why war weaponry was available in large quantities in their houses. They\ncounted 700 warriors, and were the most daring amongst the Jewish community in\nArabia, and now the first to breach the covenant of cooperation and non- aggression\nwhich they had already countersigned with the Prophet [pbuh]. Their behaviour grew\ntoo impolite and unbearable. They started a process of trouble- making, jeering at\nthe Muslims, hurting those who frequented their bazaars, and even intimidating their\nwomen. Such things began to aggravate the general situation, so the Prophet [pbuh]\ngathered them in assemblage, admonished and called them to be rational, sensible\nand guided and cautioned against further transgression. Nevertheless they remained\nobdurate and paid no heed to his warning, and said: \"Don’t be deluded on account of\ndefeating some Quraishites inexperienced in the art of war. If you were to engage us\nin fight, you will realize that we are genuine war experts.\"\n\n-- 149 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n150\nIn this regard, the Words of Allâh were revealed saying:\n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) to those who disbelieve: ‘You will be defeated\nand gathered together to Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest.’ There\nhas already been a Sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in\ncombat — i.e. the battle of Badr): One was fighting in the cause of Allâh, and\nas for the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them\n(the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they\nwere thrice their number). And Allâh supports with His Victory whom He\npleases. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.\" \t[Al- Qur'an\n3:12,13] \t[Sunan Abu Da'ud with Aunul-Ma'bood 3/115; Ibn Hisham 1/552]\nThe answer of Banu Qainuqa‘ amounted, as seen, to war declaration. The Prophet\n[pbuh] suppressed his anger and advised the Muslims to be patient and forbearing\nand wait for what time might reveal.\nThe Jews, went too far in their transgression, presumptuous behaviour and licentious\npractices. One day a Jewish goldsmith provoked a Muslim woman whose genitals\nbecome uncovered when he had tied the edge of the garment to her back. A Muslim\nman happened to be there and killed the man; the Jews retaliated by killing that\nMuslim. The man’s family called the Muslims for help and war started. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/47,48]\nOn Saturday, Shawwal 15th, 2 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] marched out with his\nsoldiers, Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, carrying the standard of the Muslims and laid\nsiege to the Jews’ forts for 15 days. Allâh cast fear into their hearts, and they were\nobliged to defer to the Messenger[pbuh]’s judgement on their lives, wealth, women\nand children; their hands were tied behind their backs.\nAt this point, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul started his hypocritical role and began to\nintercede for them persistently on grounds of former alliance between those Jews\nand His tribe Khazraj. Muhammad [pbuh] dealt with this man as being a Muslim --\nHe had faked conversion into Islam for only one month, by that time -- and so he\ngranted him his request; for Islam accepts people at their face value. Banu Qainuqa‘\nhanded over all materials, wealth and war equipage to the Prophet [pbuh], who set\naside one fifth and distributed the rest to his men. After that they were banished out\nof all Arabia to Azru‘a in Syria where they stayed for a while and soon perished\naway.\nAs-Sawiq Invasion\nTwo- pronged hostile activities were being independently conducted against the\nProphet [pbuh]; plots and intrigues being hatched by Safwan bin Omaiyah, the\nhypocrites and Jews on the one hand, going on and on parallel lines with military\nhostilities being prepared by Abu Sufyan aiming at saving the face of his people and\nimpressing on the other Arabs that Quraish was still a military power to be counted\nfor. In the aftermath of Badr, Abu Sufyan was burning for revenge and took a\nsolemn vow he would never bathe off impurity unless he had avenged himself on\nMuhammad [pbuh] and his followers. He set out at the head of 200 men towards\nMadinah but was not brave enough to attack it in broad daylight. He, instead\nresorted to acts of piracy that are performed in the dark. He infiltrated into the\nProphet [pbuh]’s town and went to see an old ally Huyai bin Akhtab, who was too\ncowardly to let him in, so he left for Salam bin Mashkam, chief of Bani Nadeer, a\n\n-- 150 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n151\ntribe of Jews. The Jew entertained and gave him a full account of the situation\ntherein. Late at night he despatched a group of his men to raid Al- ‘Uraid, a suburb of\nMadinah. There, the men felled and burnt the palm trees, killed two Muslims and\nthen took swiftly to their heels.\nOn hearing the news, the Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and set out at their\nheels, but could not catch them. The Muslims brought back the provisions (Sawiq, a\nkind of barley porridge) which the polytheists had thrown aside in order to lighten\ntheir loads and hasten their escape; hence this campaign was called As- Sawiq\nInvasion. It took place in Dhul- Hijjah 2 A.H., two months after the event of Badr.[Za'd\nAl-Ma'ad 2/90,91; Ibn Hisham 2/44,45]\nDhi Amr Invasion, Muharram, 3 A.H\nThe Prophet [pbuh]’s intelligence personnel reported that Banu Tha‘labah and Banu\nMuhârib were mustering troops with the aim of raiding the outskirts of Madinah. The\nProphet [pbuh] at the head of 450 horsemen and footmen set out to handle this new\nsituation. ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan was asked to dispose the affairs of the Muslims in\nMadinah. On their way, they captured a man who embraced Islam and acted as a\nguide for the army. When the enemies heard of the approach of the Muslims, they\nhurriedly dispersed in the mountains and disappeared. The Muslims encamped at a\nwatering place called \"Dhi Amr\" for the whole of Safar 3 A.H. The Prophet [pbuh]\naimed to impress upon the desert bedouins in the area, that the Muslims were then\npowerful enough to cast fear and awe into the hearts of their enemies. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91;\nIbn Hisham 2/46]\nKa‘b bin Al-Ashraf, killed\nKa‘b bin Al- Ashraf was the most resentful Jew at Islam and the Muslims, the keenest\non inflicting harm on the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the most zealous advocate\nof waging war against him. He belonged to Tai’ tribe but his mother to Banu Nadeer.\nHe was a wealthy man known for his handsomeness, and a poet living in luxury in\nhis fort south east of Madinah at the rear of Banu Nadeer’s habitations.\nOn hearing the news of Badr, he got terribly exasperated and swore that he would\nprefer death to life if the news was true. When this was confirmed he wrote poems\nsatirizing Muhammad [pbuh], eulogizing Quraish and enticing them against the\nProphet [pbuh]. He then rode to Makkah where he started to trigger the fire of war,\nand kindle rancour against the Muslims in Madinah. When Abu Sufyan asked him\nwhich religion he was more inclined to, the religion of the Makkans or that of\nMuhammad [pbuh] and his companions, he replied that the pagans were better\nguided. With respect to this situation, Allâh revealed His Words:\n\"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They\nbelieve in \tJibt \tand \tTaghût, and say to the disbelievers that they are better\nguided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 4:51]\nHe then returned to Madinah to start a fresh campaign of slanderous propaganda\nthat took the form of obscene songs and amatory sonnets with a view to defaming\nthe Muslim women.\n\n-- 151 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n152\nAt this stage, the situation became unbearable and could no longer be put up with.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and said: \"Who will kill Ka‘b bin Al- Ashraf? He\nhad maligned Allâh, and His Messenger.\" Thereupon, Muhammad bin Maslamah,\n‘Abbad bin Bishr, Al- Harith bin Aws, Abu ‘Abs bin Hibr and Salkan bin Salamah,\nKa‘b’s foster brother, volunteered to do the job.\nMuhammad bin Maslamah said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, do you wish that I should kill\nhim?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit).\" He\nsaid: \"Talk (as you like).\" So, Muhammad bin Maslamah came to Ka‘b and talked to\nhim, saying: \"This man (i.e. the Prophet [pbuh]) has made up his mind to collect\ncharity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship.\" When he heard this, Ka‘b\nsaid: \"By Allâh you will be put to more trouble by him.\" Muhammad bin Maslamah\nanswered: \"No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to\nforsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give\nme a loan.\" He said: \"What will you mortgage?\" Muhammad answered: \"What do you\nwant?\" The immoral and heartless Jew demanded women and children as articles of\nsecurity against the debt. Muhammad said: \"Should we pledge our women whereas\nyou are the most handsome of the Arabs; and the son of one of us may be abused\nby saying that he was pledged for two \twasq \t(measurement unit of weight) of dates\nbut we can pledge you (our) weapons.\" Ka‘b agreed. Salkan bin Salamah, Abu\nNa’ilah, at another time, went to see Ka‘b for the same purpose and there were more\nor less the same subjects, only that Abu Na’ilah would bring him some companions.\nThe plan was successful and provided for the presence of both men and weapons. On\nRabi‘ Al- Awwal 14th, at night, the year 3 A.H. the people said good bye to the\nProphet [pbuh] and set out in the Name of Allâh to implement the carefully drawn\nplan. The Prophet [pbuh] stayed back praying for them and supplicating Allâh to\nrender them success. The men went and called upon him at night. He came down\nalthough his wife warned him not to meet them alleging that: \"I hear a voice which\nsounds like the voice of murder.\" He said: \"It is only Muhammad bin Maslamah and\nmy foster brother Abu Na’ilah. When a gentleman is called at night even if he be\npierced with a spear, he should respond to the call.\" Abu Na’ilah said to his\ncompanions: \"As he comes down, I will extend my hand towards his head to smell\nand when I hold him fast, you should do your job.\" So when he came down, they\ntalked together for about an hour. They then invited him to go out and spend a nice\ntime in the moonlight. On the way out, Abu Na’ilah remarked: \"I smell the nicest\nperfume from you.\" Ka‘b said: \"Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most\nscented of the women of Arabia.\" Abu Na’ilah again said: \"Allow me to smell (the\nscent on your head)\". He said: \"Yes, you may smell.\" So he caught it and smelt.\nThen he said: \"Allow me to do so(once again).\" He then held his head fast and said\nto his companions: \"Do your job.\" And they killed him. The group of men came back\nafter fulfilling their mission. One of them Al- Harith bin Aws was wounded by mistake\nwith the swords of his men, and was bleeding badly. When they reached Baqee‘ Al-\nGharqad, they shouted, \"Allâh is Great\". The Prophet [pbuh] heard them and realized\nthat they had killed the enemy of Allâh. As they saw him, he said: \"Cheerful faces\nare yours.\" In reply, they said: \"And yours O Messenger of Allâh.\" They handed the\nhead of the tyrant over to him. He entertained Allâh’s praise for their success. He\nthen applied his saliva to Al- Harith’s wound and it healed on the spot.[Ibn Hisham 1/51-57;\nSahih Al-Bukhari 1/341, 425, 2/577; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91' and Sunan Abu Da'ud with 'Aun-ul-Ma'bood 2/42,43]\nWhen the Jews learned about the death of their tyrant, Ka‘b bin Al- Ashraf, they were\nscared and even their stonelike hearts were in the grip of inexpressible panic. They\nrealized that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] would thenceforth never hesitate to use\n\n-- 152 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n153\nforce when good words and admonition failed. They remained silent and resigned,\nand faked adherence to covenants.\nNow the Prophet [pbuh] was free to collect his thoughts and give himself up to\nresolving foreign affairs, and facing dangers that could be carried with hostile wind\nblowing again from Makkah.\nThe Invasion of Buhran\nIn Rabi‘ Ath- Thani, the year 3 A.H. the Prophet [pbuh] led a campaign comprising\n300 warriors to Buhran in the area of Al- Furu‘. He stayed there till Jumada Al- Ula, 3\nA.H. No fighting took place in the process of this patrolling invasion. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/50,51; Za'd\nAl-Ma'ad 2/91]\nZaid bin Harithah leads a Campaign on the Trade Routes of Quraish\nThis was the most successful campaign prior to Uhud Battle. It took place in Jumada\nAth- Thaniyah, the year 3 A.H.\nSummer approached and it was high time for the Makkan trade caravans to leave for\nSyria. The people of Quraish whose lives depended mainly on a mercantile economy\nconsisting of summer caravans to Syria and winter caravans to Abyssinia (Ethiopia),\nwere now at a loss as to what route they would have to follow in order to avoid the\nbackbreaking military strikes that the Muslims successfully inflicted on the\npolytheists.\nThey held a meeting to discuss the chances of escaping the economic blockade and\ndecided to go along a trade route across Najd to Iraq. Furat bin Haiyan was\nappointed as a guide for the caravan. Safwan bin Omaiyah led the caravan along the\nnew route. News of the meeting leaked out through Na‘im bin Mas‘ud Al- Ashja‘i\nunder the effect of wine, and it flew fast to Madinah by Sulit bin An- Nu‘man. The\nProphet [pbuh] immediately mustered 100 horsemen under the leadership of Zaid\nbin Harithah Al- Kalbi and despatched them to intercept and capture the caravan.\nThey caught up with the camels at a place called Al- Qardah. They took the\npolytheists by surprise and arrested their guide and two other men. Safwan and his\nguards fled away without showing the least resistance. The caravan was carrying\nsilver and wares whose value amounted to 100 thousand dirhams. The booty was\ndistributed among the Muslim warriors after one- fifth had been set aside for the\nProphet [pbuh]. Furat bin Haiyan embraced Islam out of his own sweet free will. \t[Ibn\nHisham 1/50,51; Fiqh As-Seerah p.190; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/219]\nAs a result of this episode, the Muslims foiled Quraish’s plans to find a new trade\nroute. The economic siege laid to Makkah was thus consolidated and had a great\nimpact on the mercantile economy of Makkah. The Makkans were terribly anxious\nand worried about their prospects of life now at stake with no hope whatsoever for\nany possible rehabilitation of commercial life or redemption of former prestige at the\nsocio- political level except through two avenues categorically contrasting:\nRelinquishing all symbols of arrogance and all attitudes of haughtiness through\nreconciliation with the new status quo, and peaceableness with the Muslims; or\nlaunching a decisive overwhelming war with the aim of crushing down the military\nforces of Madinah. It was apparent through the process of events that Quraish had\nopted for the second alternative. Loud cries were being heard everywhere in Makkah\n\n-- 153 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n154\ndemanding immediate vengeance and quick retaliatory action. These movements on\nall levels constituted the direct preliminaries to the battle of Uhud.\n\n-- 154 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n155\nThe Battle of Uhud\nThe defeat at Badr was an ignominy which the Quraishites pride could not leave\nunavenged. Revenge was, therefore, the catchword all over Makkah. The Makkans\neven forbade lamenting over their murdered people, or ransoming their captives at\nBadr Battle lest the Muslims should realize the grave degree of sadness and feeling\nof tragedy they were experiencing.\nIn the wake of Badr event, Quraish was in common consent and started fresh\npreparations to launch an overall war against the Muslims in order to restore their\nblemished prestige and wounded pride. The most enthusiastic polytheists desiring to\ngo into a new battle were ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Omaiyah, Abu Sufyan bin\nHarb, and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a. They were determined to crush the\ncommonwealth of Islam once and for all. Emissaries were sent to all the tribes to\nmake common cause against the rising Faith. As a consequence of this, they\nmanaged to enlist the support of two well- known tribes Kinana and Tihamah besides\nsome desert bedouins \tAhabish. It was also decided that the profits of the escaped\ncaravan headed by Abu Sufyan, which amounted to 1000 camels and 50 thousand\nDinars, should be devoted for providing equipment to the army. The Noble Qur’ân\nhas alluded to this decision of theirs in the following words:\n\" Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder (men) from the\npath of Allâh, and so will they continue to spend it; but in the end it will\nbecome an anguish for them. Then they will be overcomed.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 8:36]\nThey also devised other ways of recruitment including hiring poets to entice the\ntribes into fighting the Muslims. Safwan bin Omaiyah allured Abu ‘Azza, the poet to\nwork in this context in return for riches after the war or supporting his daughters if\nkilled. Incidentally, this poet was prisoner of war (in the context of the Badr events)\nin the hands of the Muslims and the Prophet [pbuh] was gracious enough to release\nhim unransomed provided he would not engage in fight against him.\nAbu Sufyan nursed the most grudge against Muslims because he had lost most of his\nsupplies in As- Sawiq invasion, let alone the heavy economic losses that Quraish had\nsustained in the aftermath of the events that featured the platoon of Zaid bin\nHarithah.\nIn the light of these successive failures, Quraish precipitated and accelerated their\npreparations for a decisive battle with the Muslims. At the turn of the year everything\nwas ready for the move. The Makkans also decided to take their women along with\nthem for they might arouse them to fight manfully. Thus a contingent of three\nthousand pitched warriors, of whom seven hundred were mailed soldiers and two\nhundred well- mounted [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/92; Fath Al- Bari 7/346] \tcavalry with three thousand\ncamels and fifteen women marched towards Madinah. The general leader was Abu\nSufyan bin Harb, the cavalry under the leadership of Khalid bin Al- Waleed assisted\nby ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, and Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar were entrusted with the flag.\nOld deep- seated feelings of hatred, with heart- based grudge enveloped the whole\nprocess foreshadowing bitter, bloody revenge- instigated fighting between the two\nparties.\n\n-- 155 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n156\nMeanwhile Al- ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, was closely watching the military\nmovements and preparations for war, and these were all included in an urgent\nmessage sent by him to Prophet [pbuh] who received it while he was in Qubâ’\nMosque. Ubai bin Ka‘b read the letter to the Prophet [pbuh], who asked him to be\nreticent with respect to its serious contents. He hurried back to Madinah, convened a\nmeeting with the Helpers and Emigrants and conducted with them serious\nconsultations as regards the measures to be taken.\nThe whole of Madinah was put on the alert and all men were heavily armed even\nduring prayer in anticipation of any emergency. A group of Helpers volunteered to\nguard the Prophet [pbuh] and kept watchful eye all night at his door, amongst whom\nthere were Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, Usaid bin Hudair and Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. Lest they should\nbe taken by surprise, armed groups of the Madinese began to police the entrances\nand roads leading to the city. To reconnoitre the movements of the polytheists,\nMuslim platoons began to patrol the routes for any probable enemy raids.\nThe Makkan army, on the other hand, continued the march along the usual western\nroad. On reaching Al- Abwâ’, Hind bint ‘Utbah, Abu Sufyan’s wife, suggested that they\ndig up the grave of the Prophet [pbuh]’s mother, but the leaders of the army refused\nto do so for fear of the consequent results. The army then followed Wadi Al- ‘Aqeeq\nand turned right to encamp themselves at a place called ‘Ainain near Uhud Mountain.\nThat was on Friday, 6th Shawwal, 3 A.H.\nA Consultation Assembly for a Defence Plan\nThe scouting party of Madinah conveyed the news of the Makkan army step by step.\nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] held a head military consultation assembly to\nexchange views about the situation. He told them about a dream he had. He said:\n\"By Allâh, I have dream",
  "t of — I implore Allâh to be a dream of bounty — cows\nslaughtered and that there was a groove at the pointed top of my sword, and that I\nhad inserted my hand into an immune armour.\"\nThe interpretation of ‘the cows’ was that some of his men were killed, and ‘the\ngroove at the pointed top of his sword’ was that a member of his House would be\nhurt. As for ‘the armour’ it was Madinah. Then he offered a suggestion that his\nCompanions should not go out of Madinah and that they should encamp themselves\nwithin the city. He was of the opinion that the enemies should be left in the open to\nexhaust themselves and thus the Muslims would not risk a battle. But if they thought\nof attacking Madinah, Muslim men would be ready to fight them at the mouths of\nlanes; whereas Muslim- women would help from over the house roofs.\" ‘Abdullah bin\nUbai bin Salul — the head of the hypocrites; who attended the meeting as a chief of\nAl- Khazraj — supported the Prophet [pbuh]’s plan.\nAs a matter of fact his agreement was not based on the righteousness of the plan\nbut rather on personal benefit. He did not want to fight. On the contrary he secretly\naimed at being far away from fight. However it was Allâh’s Will that he should be\ndisclosed and disgraced in public — for the first time. It was His Will that the curtain\nwhich concealed their disbelief behind should be uncovered and pulled down. Allâh’s\nWill enabled the Muslims to recognize the reality of those snakes that were creeping\nwithin their garments and inside the sleeves of their clothes. Thanks to Allâh they\nrecognized them in one of the most critical times of their lives.\n\n-- 156 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n157\nSome of the best honourable Companions, who had missed \tAl- Jihâd \tin Badr invasion,\nsuggested that the Prophet [pbuh] should go out of Madinah and urged him to\naccept their point of view. One of them said: \"O, Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], for long\ntime we have been looking forward to this day; and we have implored Allâh to make\nsuch a day draw near. Thanks to Allâh it is time to fight. So let us go out and fight\nour enemies lest they should think that we have lost heart and do not dare to fight\nthem.\" Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib the paternal uncle of the Prophet [pbuh], who had\nalready covered the ornaments of his sword with idolaters’ blood in Badr Battle, was\nahead of those enthusiastics who urged him to go out and meet the disbelievers. He\nsaid to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"By Allâh, Who has sent the Book down unto you, I will\nnot taste food till I fight them with my sword outside Madinah.\" [As- Seerah Al- Halabiyah\n2/14]\nAfter weighing carefull the pros and cons of the issue, it was decided that the enemy\nshould be resisted outside the city at Uhud.\nDividing the Islamic Army into Phalanxes and Departure to the Battle-field\nAscending the pulpit at the Friday congregational prayer, the Prophet [pbuh] urged\nthe people in his sermon to fight courageously. \"If you remain steadfast,\" he said\n\"you will be helped by the Power of the All- Mighty.\" Then he commanded his men to\nmake ready for the battle. Most of them rejoiced greatly.\nHe led the afternoon prayer with crowds of people. Then he entered his house\naccompanied by his two friends Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. They helped him dress and\nwear his headcloth. He armed himself and wore two armours one over the other. He\nwore his sword and went out to meet people.\nPeople were waiting for him impatiently. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Usaid bin Hudair\nblamed people for pressing on the Prophet [pbuh]. They said: \"You have forced the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] to fight the enemy outside Madinah.\" Therefore they were\ndetermined to leave the whole matter to the Prophet [pbuh], and blamed themselves\nfor what they had already done. When the Prophet [pbuh] came out, they said: \"O\nMessenger of Allâh, we should have not disagreed with you. So, you are free to do\nwhat you desire. If you prefer to stay inside Madinah we will stay with you. Upon this\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: \"It does not become a Prophet that once\nhe had put on armour, he should take it off, until Allâh has decided between him and\nthe enemy.\" \t[Quoted by Ahmad, Nasa'i, Hakim and Ibn Ishaq]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] divided his army into three battalions:\n1. \tAl- Muhajireen battalion, under the command of Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al- ‘Abdari.\n2. \tAl- Ansari- Aws battalion was commanded by Usaid bin Hudair.\n3. \tAl- Ansari- Khazraj battalion with Al- Hubab bin Al- Mundhir to lead it.\nThe army consisted of a thousand fighters; a hundred of them armoured; another\nfifty horsemen. \t[Al- Huda 2,92] \tHe appointed Ibn Umm Maktum to lead the people in\nprayer in Madinah. Departure was announced and the army moved northwards with\nthe two Sa‘ds, who were armoured, running in front of the army.\n\n-- 157 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n158\nUpon passing along Al- Wada‘ mountain trail he saw a well- armed battalion, which\nwere detached from the main body of the army. The Prophet [pbuh] inquired who\nthey were and he was told that they were Jews and were allies of Al- Khazraj. They\ntold him that they wanted to contribute to the fight against the idolaters. \"Have they\nembraced Islam?\" The Prophet [pbuh] asked. \"No,\" they said. So he refused\nadmitting them and said that he would not seek the assistance of disbelievers\nagainst the idolaters.\nParading the Army\nAs soon as he reached a location called Ash- Shaikhan, he paraded his army. He\ndismissed those whom he considered to be disabled or too young to stand the fight.\nAmong them were ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab. Usama bin Zaid; Usaid bin\nZaheer, Zaid bin Thabit, Zaid bin Arqam. ‘Araba bin Aws, ‘Amr bin Hazm, Abu Sa‘eed\nAl- Khudri, Zaid bin Haritha Al- Ansari, Sa‘d bin Habba and Al- Barâ’ bin ‘Azib, Sahih Al-\nBukhari pointed out that he had shared in the fight that day.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] allowed both Rafi‘ bin Khadaij and Samura bin Jundub\nto join the army — though they were too young. The former proved to be skillful at\nshooting arrows; the latter wrestled the former and beat him. The admission of Rafi‘\nmade Samura say: \"I am stronger than him, I can overcome him.\" When the Prophet\n[pbuh] heard this saying he ordered them to wrestle. They did. Samura won so he\nwas also admitted.\nPassing the Night between Uhud and Madinah\nAs night fell upon them there, they performed both the sunset and the evening\nprayers and spent the night there as well. Fifty people were chosen to guard the\ncamp and go round it. Muhammad bin Maslama Al- Ansari, the hero of the brigade of\nKa‘b bin Al- Ashraf, was in charge of the guards. Whereas Dhakwan bin ‘Abd Qais\nundertook the responsibility of guarding the Prophet [pbuh], in particular.\nThe Rebellion of ‘Abdullah bin Ubai and his Followers\nAt the end of the night and just before it was daybreak, the Prophet [pbuh] moved\nand when he got to Ash- Shawt he observed the dawn prayer. There he was close\nenough to the enemy that they could see one another. It was there that ‘Abdullah\nbin Ubai — the hypocrite — rebelled against the Muslims. One- third of the army\nwithdrew with him — that is to say three hundred fighters. He said, \"We do not know\nwhy we shall kill ourselves.\" He claimed that his withdrawal was no more than\nshowing protest against the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who had already refused his\nopinion and accepted that of the others.\nUndoubtedly that was not the real cause of his detachment. If it had been the refusal\nof his opinion — as the hypocrite claimed — there would have no sense whatsoever\nfor his joining the Prophetic army. If it had been so, he would have refused to go out\nwith the army from the very beginning of the march. As a matter of fact the real\npurpose of this rebellion, withdrawal and detachment — at this delicate and awkward\nposition and time — was to produce bewilderment, confusion of mind, and disorder\nin the Muslims army who were within the sight and hear range of the enemy who\nwere also looking forward to seeing more and more dissension on the side of the\n\n-- 158 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n159\nMuslims, like themselves. They also aimed at breaking the high morale of the\nbelievers. That would accelerate — in their opinion — the breakdown and\nconsequently the death of Muhammad, his faithful Companions and Islam as a\nwhole. The way would then be clear for the reclaim of presidency, which that\nhypocrite had lost on the advent of Islam into Madinah.\nShort of Allâh’s Care, the hypocrite’s plot would have been successful. Banu Haritha\nof Al- Aws and Banu Salama of Al- Khazraj were partially impressed by the hypocrite’s\nbehaviour. Both of them were overwhelmed by confusion and they had almost\nstarted to withdraw, but Allâh’s Care saved them from that disgrace. About their\nincident Allâh says:\n\"When two parties from among you were about to lose their heart, but Allâh\nwas their \tWali \t(Supporter and Protector). And in Allâh should the believers\nput their trust.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:122]\n‘Abdullah bin Haram — the father of Jabir bin ‘Abdullah — attempted to stop their\nwithdrawal. He reminded the hypocrites of their duty at this delicate and awkward\ncondition, but in vain. He followed them, reproached them and urged them to go\nback saying: \"Come and fight in the way of Allâh or at least be defenders.\" They\nsaid: \"If we had known that you would really fight we would have not gone back.\"\nHaving despaired of them, he addressed them saying: \"May Allâh cast you away, you\nenemies of Allâh. Allâh will certainly suffice His Prophet.\" Allâh says about those\nhypocrites:\n\"And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: ‘Come, fight in\nthe way of Allâh or (at least) defend yourselves.’ They said: ‘Had we known\nthat fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.’ They\nwere that day, nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths\nwhat was not in their hearts. And Allâh has full knowledge of what they\nconceal.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:167]\nThe Remainder of the Islamic Army are on the Move to Uhud\nWith the remainder of fighters, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] moved towards the\nenemy. After the rebellion and withdrawal of the hypocrites, the number of soldiers\nwas reduced to seven hundred only.\nThe camp of idolaters was situated in such a place that the many roads leading to\nUhud were almost blocked by them. So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to his\nmen: \"Which man of you can lead us to where the people (i.e. the idolaters) are,\nalong a short track that does not pass by them?\" Abu Khaithama said: \"O Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh], I am the man you need.\" Then he chose a short track that led to\nUhud passing by Harrah Bani Harithah and their farms, leaving the idolaters’ army\nwestwards.\nOn their way they passed by \tHa’it \t(i.e. the field) of Marba‘ bin Qaizi, who was a blind\nhypocrite. When Marba‘ felt and realized that they were the Prophetic army, he\nstarted throwing earth at their faces, so they rushed to kill him, but the Prophet\n[pbuh] said:\n\n-- 159 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n160\n\"Do not kill him. He is blind in heart and eyes.\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] went along till climbed down the hillock of Uhud at\nthe slope of the valley. He camped there with his army facing Madinah while their\nbacks were to the hills of Uhud mountain. So the army of the enemy stood a barrier\nbetween the Muslims and Madinah.\nThe Defence Plan\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] mobilized his army. He arranged them into two rows\nto prepare them for fight. He selected fifty skillful archers that formed a squad and\nmade them under the command of ‘Abdullah bin Jubair bin An- Nu‘man Al- Ansari Al-\nAwsi Al- Badri. He issued his orders to them to stay where they were — on a\nmountain(side) at the south bank of Qanat Al- Wadi (i.e. a canal of the valley), south\neast of Muslims camp at about one hundred and fifty metres from the Islamic army.\nLater on this mountain was called the Mountain of Archers.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] clarified the mission of this squad in words he\ndirected to them. He said to their leader: \"Drive off the horses from us by means of\narrows, lest they should attack us from behind (the rear). Whether we win the battle\nor lose it, stand steadily in your position and mind that we are not attacked from\nyour side.\"[Ibn Hisham 2/65,66]\nHe added:\n\"Defend our backs! If you see us slain. Do not come to assist us; and if you\nsee gaining grounds, do not share us.\"[Fath Al- Bari 7/350]\nIn a version by Al- Bukhâri the Prophet [pbuh] said:\n\"If you see us snatched into pieces by birds, do not leave this position of\nyours till I send for you. And if you see that we have defeated the enemy\nand trodden on them do not desert your position till I send for you.\"[Sahih\nAl- Bukhari, the Book of Jihad 1/426]\nWith the assignment of this squad and locating it on the mountainside and the\nissuance of those strict military orders, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] blocked the\nonly groove that might lead the idolaters stealthily to the rear of Muslim ranks and\nmight even enable them to encircle them in an encompassment procedure.\nThe assignments of posts and responsibilities for the rest of the army were\nperformed by the Prophet [pbuh] as follows: On the right wing, he appointed Al-\nMundhir bin ‘Amr. On the left he appointed Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam, and made Al-\nMiqdad bin Al- Aswad his assistant and supporter. Az- Zubair’s function was to\nstandfast in the face of Khalid bin Al- Waleed’s horsemen. The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] selected the top and the most courageous group to be in the vanguard of the\narmy. They were notable for their readiness, alertness and bravery and estimated to\nbe equal to thousands of men.\nIt was a wise and carefully- laid plan which revealed the genius of military leadership\nthat the Prophet [pbuh] possessed. No other leader could have drawn a more\n\n-- 160 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n161\naccurate or wise plan. Although he approached the site later than the enemy, he\nmanaged to occupy better positions. He made the rocky mountainside to function as\nshield for the army’s rear and right flank. He was able, by blocking the only\nvulnerable gap on the side, to provide additional maximum protection for the rear as\nwell as the left wing. For fear of possible defeat, and to deter the Muslims from\nfleeing, in which case they would fall easy prisoners in the hands of the enemy, he\nchose a high place for encampment. Moreover a strategic site of this sort would\nsurely inflict heavy losses on the polytheists if they thought of approaching or\noccupying his positions. In a further step, he reduced the enemy to a narrow scope\nof choice when they were cornered for encampment in geographically low positions\nthat would avail them nothing of the benefits of any possible victory; at the same\ntime they would not be able to escape the pursuit of the Muslims in case victory\nsided with the latter. To make up for the quantitative shortage in fighting personnel,\nhe chose a picked body of fighters to stand at the front.\nThe army of the Prophet [pbuh] was thus fully mobilized on Shawwal 7th, 3 A.H.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implants the Spirit of Bravery among his Armed\nForces\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] forbade the Muslims to start the fight without having\nan order from him. He, then, wore two armours — a front armour and a back one.\nHe urged his Companions to fight and spurred them to show stamina and\nsteadfastness at fight. He started to implant the spirit of boldness and bravery in\nthem. To wage and inflame his Companions and in order to standfast in the fight, he\ntook a sharp sword, held it in his hand and called out unto his Companions and said:\n\"Who is ready to take this sword and give it its proper due?\" Many a man set out to\ntake it. Some of them were ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam and ‘Umar bin\nAl- Khattab. But it was granted to none. Abu Dujana Sammak bin Kharsha inquired:\n\"O Messenger of Allâh, what is its price?\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"It is to strike the\nenemy’s faces with it till it was bent.\" So Abu Dujana said: \"O Messenger of Allâh I\nwill take it for that price.\" and he was given the sword.\nAbu Dujana was a man of courage who used to swagger at war. He had a red band\nwhich he wore round his head. Whenever he was head- banded everybody knew that\nhe was determined to fight to death. Therefore as soon as Abu Dujana took the\nProphet [pbuh]’s sword, he banded his head and started strutting amongst the\nfighters.\nWatching him doing that, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"This is a sort of\nwalking that Allâh detests except in such a situation.\"\nRecruitment of the Makkan Army\nThe idolaters applied the rows system in the mobilization of their army. The general\nleadership of the army was entrusted to Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb, who would be in\nthe centre- position of the army. Khalid bin Al- Waleed was on the right wing; whereas\n‘Ikrima, the son of Abu Jahl was on the left. Safwan bin Omaiya was in charge of\ninfantry men. The archers were under the command of ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a.\n\n-- 161 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n162\nAs for the standard, a squad of Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar were in charge to bear it. Thus was\nthe distribution of the posts of the army ever since ‘Abd Munaf had already assigned\nthem. This assignment had been inherited from Qusai bin Kilab — as we have\npreviously alluded to in an early phase of this book. No one had the right to compete\nthem with it. It was consistent with their traditions that they had inherited from their\nancestors.\nAbu Sufyan, the general leader, reminded his men — the standard bearers — of what\nhad happened to Quraish on Badr Day (i.e. battle) when their standard bearer, An-\nNadr bin Al- Harith, was captured. In an attempt to wage their anger and enmity to\nthe Muslims he said: \"O Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar! You have been assigned bearers of our\nstandard and you know that the standard is the first thing that the enemy attacks.\nShould it fall, we fall down too. Therefore, I say either you guarantee its safety or\nleave it for us, and we will certainly suffice you that task.\"\nAbu Sufyan’s attempt seemed to be fruitful. For his speech made Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar\nso extremely angry that they threatened him and almost attacked him for that.\nAddressing him, they said: \"You want us to deliver you the custodianship of the\nstandard? Tomorrow when we fight them, you will witness our deeds.\" As a matter of\nfact, they fought bravely and stoodfast in defence of the standard till they were all\nkilled.\nPolitical Manoeuvres of Quraish\nA little time before the break out of the battle, Quraish made some endeavours to\nsow the seeds of discord and dispute among the Muslims. First, Abu Sufyan sent to\nthe Helpers a message saying: \"Leave us alone to fight our cousins and do not\ninterfere. If you stand aside, we will not fight you; for fighting you is not a target of\nours.\" But that attempt proved to be fruitless. What could such a wicked scheme do\nto those whose Faith was as solid and firm as mountains?! The Helpers reply was\nundoubtedly disappointing and contrary to Abu Sufyan’s expectations.\nThe zero- hour was due. The two parties drew nearer. Undespaired by the first\nfailure, Quraish made another attempt, for the same purport but now with the\nassistance of a traitor called Abu ‘Amir Al- Fasiq, whose name was ‘Abd ‘Amr bin Saifi.\nHe was called a monk, but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] nicknamed him \tAl- Fâsiq\n(i.e. perverted transgressor; dissolute). As he was the head of Aws in \tAl- Jahiliya, he\ncould not tolerate Islam when it came. He announced his enmity to the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] in public. He left Madinah for the Quraishites in Makkah to rally them\nagainst the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and to urge them to start the fight against\nhim. He claimed that he was obeyed and esteemed by his people and that as soon as\nthey saw him come they would join him immediately.\nSo he was the first one among the mob and slaves of Quraish to show resistance. He\ncalled out unto his people, recognized them and said: \"O kinfolk of Aws! I am Abu\n‘Amir.\" Their reply was \"No eyes of anybody shall be consoled by viewing you, O\nFâsiq.\" Hearing them say so, he said: \"My people must have been afflicted by an evil\nafter my departure.\" Therefore when the fight broke out, he fought them fiercely and\npelted his people with stones, as well.\n\n-- 162 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n163\nThat was how the second attempt of Quraish to sow the seeds of discord among\npeople of Faith. This, however, revealed the great terror of the Quraishites cast in\ntheir hearts in spite of their supremacy in number and equipment.\nThe effort of Quraishite Women at waging the Zeal of Men\nQuraishi- women participated in the battle led by the wife of Abu Sufyan, Hind bint\n‘Utbah. They wandered among the rows of the idolaters, tapped on tambourines,\nencouraged men to fight, inflamed the emotions of heroes, lancers, swordsmen and\nbrave fighters. At one time they addressed the standard- bearers:\n\"O Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar!\nO home defenders,\nStrike with your sharp swords …\"\nAnd at another time they would wage people’s zeal by singing:\n\"If you fight (bravely), we will embrace\nand unfold mats to welcome you.\nBut if you flee from the battlefield, we leave you,\nDesert you and no more love you.\"\nThe Combat\nThe two parties approached and grew very close to each another. The phases of fight\nstarted. The first combatant was the standard- bearer, Talha bin Abi Talha Al- ‘Abdari,\nwho was the most distinguished idolater. He was one of the bravest men of Quraish\nfighters. Muslims nicknamed him ‘the ram of the battalion.’ He came forth riding a\ncamel and challenged the Muslims to a single combat. People refrained from fighting\nhim due to his bravery; but Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam advanced for the fight. He did\nnot give the ‘Ram’ any chance to fight but fell on him like a lion on his camel’s back,\npulled him down to the ground and slaughtered him with his sword.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who was watching that wonderful incident exclaimed:\nAllâhu Akbar \tthat is ‘Allâh is the Greatest’ and the Muslims exclaimed \tAllâhu Akbar\ntoo. He praised Az- Zubair when he said:\n\"Every Prophet has a disciple and Az- Zubair is a disciple of mine.\"[As- Seerah Al-\nHalaiyah 2/18]\nSoon the general engagement ensued and the fight of the two parties grew fierce\neverywhere on the battlefield. The strain of the fight was centred round the carriers\nof the standard. After the death of their leader Talha bin Abi Talha, Banu ‘Abd Ad- Dar\nalternated the mission successively. Talha’s brother, ‘Uthman, ran forward and\nseized the standard which lay by the lifeless body of his brother, chanting: \"The\nstandard- bearer has the right to dye its shaft in blood, till it be beaten in his hand.\"\nHamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib attacked and dealt him a blow that cut his arm and\nshoulder and went down to his navel to uncover his lung.\n\n-- 163 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n164\nThe standard was raised up again by Abu Sa‘d bin Abi Talha; but Sa‘d bin Abi\nWaqqas shot him with a deadly arrow that hit him at his throat and made his tongue\nhang out breathing his last.\nIn another version it was narrated that Abu Sa‘d lifted the standard up and\nchallenged the Muslims to fight him. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib went forth. They exchanged\ntwo blows. Then ‘Ali gave him a terminal blow that finished him off.\nMusafi‘ bin Talha bin Abi Talha then hoisted the standard, but was soon shot with an\narrow by ‘Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al- Aqlah. His brother Kilab bin Talha bin Abi Talha\nfollowed him picked the banner and lifted it up; but Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam\nattacked him and managed to kill him. Their brother Al- Jallas bin Talha bin Abi Talha\nlifted the banner up but Talha bin ‘Ubaidu- Allâh stabbed him to death. They also said\nthat it was ‘Asim bin Thabit who managed to deal a terminal blow to him.\nAll those six people killed round and in defence of the standard, belonged to one\nhouse, the house of Abi Talha ‘Abdullah bin ‘Uthman bin ‘Abd Ad- Dar. Another man\nfrom Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar, called Artat bin Sharhabeel carried the standard but he also\nwas killed by ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. Others said it was Hamzah who killed him not ‘Ali.\nThen it was Shuraih bin Qariz who was killed by Quzman — he was a hypocrite who\nfought for prestige only, not in defence of Islam. Abu Zaid ‘Amr bin ‘Abd Munaf Al-\n‘Abdari lifted the standard up but he was killed by Quzman too. A son of Sharhabeel\nbin Hashim Al- ‘Abdari hoisted it again and was also killed by Quzman.\nSo we see that ten fighters of Bani ‘Abd Ad- Dar — the standard- bearers — were\nannihilated. Seeing that none of ‘Abd Ad- Dars survived to carry the standard, a slave\nof theirs — called Sawab — came to raise it. The slave showed more admirable sorts\nof bravery and steadfastness than his former masters. Sawab, the slave went on\nfighting till his hand was cut off. So he knelt down and embraced the banner, leant it\nagainst his chest and neck lest it should fall down to the ground. He remained\nfighting steadily and steadfastly till he was killed. In the meanwhile he did not stop\nsaying: \"O Allâh, have I been excused?\" After the death of the slave Sawab, the\nstandard fell down to the ground, and remained there as there was no one to carry\nit.\nWhilst the brunt of the battle centred around the standard, bitter fighting was going\non everywhere on the battlefield. The spirit of Faith overwhelmed the Muslims’\nranks; so they rushed among the idolaters as if they had been an outbreak of a\ndestructive flood that overflowed and knocked down all dams and barriers standing\nin its way \"I seek death, I seek death.\" That was their announced motto on Uhud\nDay.\nAbu Dujana, recognized by the red band worn round his head, came forth, fighting\nwith the sword of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. He was determined to pay its price\nat all costs. He killed all the idolaters that stood on his way splitting and dispersing\ntheir ranks. Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam said:\n\"I felt angry and discouraged when the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] refused to give me\nthe sword but gave it to Abu Dujana. I said to myself: ‘I am his paternal cousin —\nthe cousin of his aunt Safiya — a Quraishite, besides, I was the first who demanded\nit and yet he favoured him to me. By Allâh, I will watch how he will use it.’ So I\n\n-- 164 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n165\nfollowed him, I saw him take out his red band and wear it round his head. Seeing\nhim like that, the Helpers said, ‘Abu Dujana had worn the band of death.’ Then he\nset out saying loudly:\n‘I am the one whom my intimate friend made covenant with, when we were under\nthe palm- trees on the mountain side.\nThe covenant that we made was that I should not fight at the rear.\nBut fight at the front heroically with the sword of Allâh and His Messenger.’\nNo one stood the way of Abu Dujana but was killed. There was a man among the\nidolaters whose only target was to finish off the wounded Muslims. During the fight\nAbu Dujana drew near that man; so I implored Allâh that they might engage in\ncombat. They in fact did and exchanged two sword- strokes. The idolater struck Abu\nDujana, but he escaped it and it pierced into his leather shield. The idolater’s sword\nnow stuck to it, Abu Dujana struck him with the sword and killed him. \tIbn Hisham 2/68,69]\nInto the thick of the battle, he rushed to kill a person who was inciting the enemy to\nfight the Muslims. Upon this the person shrieked and lo! it was a woman. Abu Dujana\nspared her saying: ‘I respect the Prophet [pbuh]’s sword too much to use it on a\nwoman.’ The woman was Hind bint ‘Utbah.\"\nDescribing the same incident, Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam said: \"I saw Abu Dujana\nraising a sword over the parting part of Hind bint ‘Utba’s head then he moved it off. I\nsaid to myself: ‘Allâh and His Messenger know best.’ (i.e. know why he acted like\nthat). \t[bn Hisham 2/69] \"\nHamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib displayed wonderful feats of gallantry against the\noverwhelming odds which stood unparalled and created consternation and confusion\nin the disbelieving hosts. Heroes dispersed off his way as if they had been tree-\nleaves blown away by strong wind. In addition to his effective contribution to the\nannihilation of the idolaters who stood in defence of the standard, he was even of\nmuch greater effect at fighting against men of bravery and distinguished horsemen.\nIt was Allâh’s Will that he be murdered when he was at the top. He was not killed in\na face- to- face fight on the battlefield — in the normal way by which heroes die — but\nrather assassinated in the dead- dark as was the custom of killing generous and noble\nmen that were impossible to kill in an honourable fight.\nAssassination of Asadullâh (the Lion of Allâh) Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib\nHamzah’s assassin, Wahshi bin Harb, described how he killed Hamzah. He said:\n\"I was a slave working to Jubair bin Mut‘im, whose paternal uncle Tu‘aimah bin ‘Adi\nwas injured at Badr Battle. So when Quraish marched to Uhud, Jubair said to me: ‘If\nyou kill Hamzah, the uncle of Muhammad, stealthily you shall be manumitted.’ \"\n\"So I marched with the people to Uhud.\" He used to describe himself as, \"I am a\npicaro good at spearing.\" \"So when the two parties fought, I set out seeking\nHamzah. I saw him amidst people fighting. He was like a white and black striped\ncamel, striking severely with his sword and no one could stand on his way. By Allâh!\nWhen I was getting ready and trying to seize the fit opportunity to spear him, hiding\nsometimes behind a tree or a rock hoping that he might draw nearer and be within\nrange — at that moment I caught sight of Siba‘ bin ‘Abd Al- ‘Uzza going closer\n\n-- 165 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n166\ntowards him. When Hamzah observed him, he said: ‘Come on! O son of the ‘clitoris-\ncutter.’ — for his mother used to be a circumciser. Then he struck one strong stroke\nthat could hardly miss his head.\"\nWahshi said: \"Then I balanced my spear and shook it till I was content with it, then I\nspeared him and it went down into his stomach and issued out between his legs. He\nattempted moving towards me but he was overcome by his wound. I left him there\nwith the spear in his entrails till he die",
  "d. Then I came to him, pulled out my spear\nand returned to the encampment place. I stayed there and did not go out, for he was\nthe only one I sought. I only killed him to free myself. So as soon as I got back to\nMakkah, I became a free man.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/69-72; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/583]\nBringing the Situation under Control\nAlthough the death of \tAsad (Lion) \tof \tAllâh and His Messenger — Hamzah bin ‘Abdul\nMuttalib — was a great loss, the Muslims maintained full control over the whole\nsituation on the battlefield. On that day, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, ‘Ali bin Abi\nTalib, Az- Zubair bin Al- ‘Awwam, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh, ‘Abdullah\nbin Jahsh, Sa‘d bin Ar- Rabî‘ and Anas bin An- Nadr and others — all of them fought so\nfiercely, effectively and efficiently that they broke the strong will of the idolaters and\nscattered them.\nFrom his Wife’s lap to Sword-fights and Sorrows\nOne of the brave adventurers of that day was Hanzala Al- Ghaseel — He was Hanzala\nbin Abu ‘Amir. Abu ‘Amir was the very monk that was nicknamed ‘Al- Fâsiq’ (i.e. the\ndissolute, evildoer). He is the very one that we have recently mentioned. Hanzala,\nwho was newly married, left his wife’s bed for \tAl- Jihâd \t(Fight in the cause of Allâh).\nHe set out the moment he heard of the call to \tAl- Jihâd. When he faced the idolaters\non the battlefield, he made his way through their ranks till he reached their leader\nAbu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and had almost killed him, if he had not been ordained to\nbe a martyr. For at that moment he was seen by Shaddad bin Al- Aswad who struck\nhim to death.\nThe Contribution of the Archers Squad to the Battle\nThe archers squad whom the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] located on the Archers\nMountain, had the upper hand in administering the war activities to go in favour of\nthe Muslim army. The Makkan horsemen — commanded by Khalid bin Al- Waleed,\nsupported by Abu ‘Amir Al- Fâsiq — had for three times attacked the left wing of the\nMuslim army with the aim of crushing it and then infiltrating into the rear to create a\nsort of confusion and disorder in the ranks of the Muslims and subsequently inflict\nheavy defeat on them. But thanks to the dexterity and great efforts of the archers,\nthe three assaults were thwarted. [Fath Al-Bari 7/346]\nWar activities went on and on fierecly with the Muslims in full command of the whole\nmilitary developments until the idolaters finally staggered and retreated, leaving all\nmotives of alleged pride, and affected dignity in oblivion, and their standard trodden\nby the feet of the fighters with none ever courageous enough to approach it. It\nseemed as if the three thousand idolaters had been fighting thirty thousand Muslims\nand not merely several hundreds.\n\n-- 166 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n167\nIbn Ishaq said: \"Then Allâh sent down His Help unto the Muslims and verified His\nPromise to them. They chased the idolaters and evacuated them from their camp. No\ndoubt it was a certain defeat.\" In a version by ‘Abdullah bin Az- Zubair that his father\nhad said: \"By Allâh, I was watching the servants of Hind bint ‘Utbah and her women\nfriends fleeing with their garments gathered up. No one was there to prevent us from\ncapturing them.\" [Ibn Hisham 2/77]\nIn another version by Al- Barâ’ bin ‘Azib — mentioned in \tSahih Al- Bukhâri \t— he said:\n\"When we fought them, they fled, and their women could be seen fleeing in the\nmountains with their anklets and legs revealed.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/579] \tThe Muslims\npursued the enemies putting them to sword and collecting the spoils.\nThe Archers’ Fatal Mistake\nWhile the small army of Islam were recording the second absolute and clear victory\nover the Makkans — which was no less in splendour and glory than the first one at\nBadr — the majority of the archers on the mountainside committed a fatal mistake\nthat turned the whole situation upside down, and constituted a source of heavy\nlosses amongst the Muslims. It has almost brought about the murder of the Prophet\n[pbuh], and left a very bad impression on the fame and dignity they deservedly\nearned at Badr Battle.\nWe have already spoken about the positive orders given to the archers to hold on to\ntheir position whatever the course of the main engagement. In spite of those strict\norders, and their leader’s — ‘Abdullah bin Jubair — warning, forty archers deserted\ntheir posts, enticed by the too soon roar of victory as well as worldly avarice for the\nspoils of war. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/426] \tThe others, however, nine in number and ‘Abdullah,\ntheir leader, decided to abide by the Prophet [pbuh]’s order and stay where they\nwere until they were given leave or killed to the last. Consequently the cleft was left\ninadequately defended .\nThe shrewd Khalid bin Al- Waleed seized this golden opportunity to turn swiftly round\nto the rear of the Muslim army and encompass them. Exterminating Ibn Jubair and\nhis group, they fell promptly upon the rear of the Muslims and his horsemen uttered\na shout that signalled the new military developments. The polytheists returned once\nagain to counterattack the Muslims. An idolist woman — called ‘Umra bint ‘Alqama\nAl- Harithiyah — rushed to the lying- on- earth standard, picked it up and hoisted it.\nThe idolaters gathered together around the standard and called out unto one another\ntill they encircled the Muslims and stoodfast to fight again.\nThe Muslims consequently got entrapped between two millstones.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was then among a small group of fighters — nine in\nnumber at the rear of the army [Sahih Muslim 2/107] , watching the engagement and braving\nthe Muslim fighters. Khalid and his men took him by utter surprise, and obliged him\nto follow either of two options:\na. \tTo flee for his life and abandon his army to its doomed end, or\nb. \tTo take action at the risk of his life, rally the ranks of the Muslims again and\nwork their way through the hills of Uhud towards the encompassed army.\n\n-- 167 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n168\nThe genius of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], his peerless and matchless courage\nmade him opt for the second course. He raised his voice calling out unto his\nCompanions: \"Slaves of Allâh.\" He did that though he knew that his loud voice would\nbe heard by the idolaters before it was heard by the Muslims. He called out unto\nthem risking his life in this delicate situation.\nThe idolaters, indeed, recognized him and reached his position even before the other\nMuslims could do so.\nThe encompassment of the Muslims revealed three categories of people: The first\ngroup were those who were only interested in themselves and they went so mad that\nthey fled. They left the battlefield and did not know what happened to the others.\nSome of this group fled as far as Madinah. Some others went up the mountain.\nThe second Muslim group were those who returned to the battle, but mixed with the\nidolaters in such a way that they could not recognize one another. Consequently\nsome of them were killed by mistake. On the authority of Al- Bukhari, he states that\n‘Aishah [R] said: \"When it was Uhud Battle, the idolaters were utterly defeated.\nSatan then called out: ‘O slaves of Allâh. Beware the rear (i.e. the enemy is\napproaching from behind)’. So those who were at the front turned back and fought\nthe ones who were behind.\"\nThen Hudhaifah caught sight of his father ‘Al- Yaman’ about to be killed by other\nMuslims. So he said: \"O servants of Allâh! Beware! This is my father. This is my\nfather.\" ‘Aishah [R] said: \"But they did not part with him till he was killed.\"\nHudhaifah then said: \"May Allâh forgive you.\" And ‘Urwa said: \"By Allâh, from that\ntime on Hudhaifah has always been blessed and wealthy till he died.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/539,\n2/581; Fath Al-Bari 7/351, 362, 363] \tThat was because he forgave them and refused to take any\nblood- money for his father’s murder but recommended that it be spent in charity.\nThis Muslim group suffered from great bewilderment, and disorder prevailed among\nthem. A lot of them got lost and did not know where to go. At this awkward time\nthey heard someone calling: \"Muhammad is killed.\" This news made them even more\nbewildered and almost out of sense. Their morale broke down, or almost did in a\ngreat number of individuals. Some of them stopped fighting, slackened, and cast\ndown their weapons. Others thought of getting in touch with ‘Abdullah bin Ubai —\nthe head of the hypocrites — and seeking his assistance to fetch them a security\npledge from Abu Sufyan.\nAnas bin An- Nadr passed by those people who were shuddering of fear and panic,\nand inquired: \"What are you waiting for?\" They said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nhas been killed.\" \"What do you live for after Muhammad [pbuh]? Come on and die\nfor what the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has died for.\" Then he said: \"O Allâh I\napologize for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done; and I swear disavowal\nof what the idolaters have perpetrated.\" Then he moved on till he was encountered\nby Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh who asked him: \"Where to, Abu ‘Umar?\" Anas replied: \"Ah, how\nfine the scent of the Paradise is! I smell it here in Uhud.\" He went on and fought\nagainst the idolaters till he was killed. Nobody but his sister could recognize his dead\nbody. It had been cut and stabbed by over eighty swords, arrows or spears. It was\nby the tip of his finger that she — after the battle — recognized him. [Za'd Al Ma'ad 2/93, 96;\nSahih Al-Bukhari 2/579]\n\n-- 168 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n169\nThabit bin Ad- Dahdah called unto his people saying:\n\"O kinfolk of Helpers, if Muhammad [pbuh] were killed, Allâh is Everlasting and He\nnever dies. Fight in defence of your Faith. Allâh will help you and so you will be\nvictorious.\" A group of Helpers joined him and all set out and attacked a battalion of\nKhalid’s horsemen. He kept on fighting till he and his friends were killed. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/81]\nAn Emigrant passed by a Helper who was besmeared by blood. He said: \"O fellow!\nHave you heard of Muhammad [pbuh]’s murder?\" The Helper answered: \"If\nMuhammad [pbuh] were killed, then he must have completed the delivery of the\nMessage. So fight in defence of your religion!\"[Za'd Al Ma'ad 2/96]\nWith such boldness and encouragement, the Muslims soon recovered their spirits,\ncame round to senses and desisted the idea of surrender or contacting the hypocrite\n‘Abdullah bin Ubai. They took up arms and resumed the fight attempting to make\nway to the headquarters, particularly after the news of the Prophet [pbuh]’s death\nhad been falsified. The glad tidings nerved them, and helped them to manage quite\nsuccessfully the break of the military blockade, and concentrate their forces in an\nimmune place to resume a relentless and fierce fight against the polytheists.\nThe third group of Muslims were those who cared for nothing except the Prophet\n[pbuh]. At the head of them were notable Companions like Abu Bakr, ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and others ÑÖì Çááå Úäåã, who hastened to protect the\nProphet [pbuh] through unrivalled devotion.\nAs those groups of Muslims were receiving the blows of the idolaters and resisting\ninstantly, the fight flared up around the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who had only\nnine people around him. We have already mentioned that when the idolaters started\ntheir encompassment there were only nine persons around the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]; and that as soon as he called out unto the Muslims: \"Come on! I am the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh],\" the idolaters heard his voice and recognized him. So\nthey turned back and attacked him with all their power before any of his Companions\nran to his aid.\nA violent raging struggle broke out between the nine Muslims and the idolaters\nduring which peerless sort of love, self- sacrifice, bravery and heroism were revealed.\nMuslim, on the authority of Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] along with seven Helpers and two Emigrants, was confined to a trap when the\nidolaters attacked him. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then said: \" He who pushes\nback those idolaters, will be housed in Paradise.\" or \"He will be my Companion in\nParadise.\" One of the Helpers stepped forward and fought the idolaters in defence of\nthe Prophet [pbuh] till he was killed. Then they attacked the Messenger [pbuh]\nagain. The same process was repeated again and again till all the seven Helpers\nwere killed. Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to his two Quraishite\nCompanions: \"We have not done justice to our Companions.\" [Sahih Muslim 2/107]\nThe last of those seven Helpers was ‘Amara bin Yazeed bin As- Sakan, who kept on\nfighting till his wounds neutralized him and he fell dead. [Ibn Hisham 2/81]\n\n-- 169 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n170\nThe Most Awkward Hour in the Messenger’s Life\nAfter the fall of Ibn Sakan, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remained alone with only\nthose two Quraishites. In a version by Abu ‘Uthman — authorized in \tAs- Sahihain—\nhe said: \"At that time, there were none with the Prophet [pbuh] except Talha bin\n‘Ubaidullâh and Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/527, 2/581] \tThat was the most\nawkward and dangerous hour for the Prophet [pbuh], but it was a golden opportunity\nfor the idolaters who promptly took advantage of it. They concentrated their attack\non the Prophet [pbuh] and looked forward to killing him.\n‘Utbah bin Abi Waqqas pelted him with stones. One of the stones fell on his face. His\nlower right incisor \tRuba‘iya \t(i.e. the tooth that is between a canine and a front tooth)\nwas injured. His lower lip was wounded. He was also attacked by ‘Abdullah bin\nShihab Az- Zuhri who cleaved his forehead. ‘Abdullah bin Qami’a (Qami’a \tmeans ‘a\nhumiliated woman’), who was an obstinate strong horseman, struck him violently on\nhis shoulder with his sword; and that stroke hurt the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] for\nover a month — though it was not strong enough to break his two armours. He dealt\na heavy blow on his cheek. It was so strong that two rings of his iron- ringed helmet\npenetrated into his holy cheek. \"Take this stroke from me, I am Ibn Qami’a.\" He said\nwhile striking the Messenger with his sword. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] replied\n— while he was wiping the blood flowing on his face: \"I implore Allâh to humiliate\nyou.\" [Fath Al-Bari 7/373, 366] \t(i.e. \tAqma’aka Allâh). In \tAl- Bukhâri \tit is stated his incisor\nbroke, his head was cleaved, and that he started wiping the blood off it and saying:\n\"(I wonder) how can people who cut the face of their Prophet [pbuh] and break the\nincisor of his — he who calls them to worship Allâh. How can such people thrive or be\nsuccessful?\" About that incident, Allâh, Glory is to Him, sent down a Qur’ânic verse\nsaying:\n\"Not for you (O Muhammad [pbuh] but for Allâh) is the decision; whether\nHe turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the\nZâlimûn \t(polytheists, disobedients, and wrong- doers).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:128] \t[Sahih\nAl-Bukhari 2/582; Sahih Muslim 2/108]\nAt- Tabarani states that the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Allâh’s Wrath is great on those who\nbesmear the face of His Messenger,\" observed silence for a short while and then\nresumed saying:\n\"O Allâh, forgive my people for they have no knowledge.\" \t[Fath Al-Bari 7/373]\nIn \tSahih Muslim \tit is stated that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said:\n\"My Lord, forgive my people for they have no knowledge.\" \t[Sahih Muslim 2/108]\nIn \tAsh- Shifa \t— a book by ‘Ayad Al- Qadi — it is related that the Prophet [pbuh] said:\n\"O Allâh, guide my people for they have no knowledge.\" \t[Ash- Shifa 1/81]\nIt is quite certain that killing the Prophet [pbuh] was their primary aim, but the two\nQuraishites — Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas and Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh, who showed great and\nrare courage and fought so fiercely and boldly that — though they were only two —\nwere able to stop the idolaters short of realizing their aim. They were of the best\n\n-- 170 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n171\nskillful Arab archers and kept on militating in defence of the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] till the whole squad of idolaters was driven off him [pbuh].\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] emptied his quiver of arrows and said to Sa‘d bin Abi\nWaqqas: \"Shoot, an arrow Sa‘d. May my father and mother be sacrified for you.[Sahih\nAl-Bukhari 1/407, 2/580, 581]\" The Prophet [pbuh] had never gathered his parents except in\nthe case of Sa‘d — a privilege granted to him for his efficiency.[ibid 1/407, 2/580,581]\nIn a version by Jabir — authorized by An- Nasa’i — concerning the attitude of Talha\nbin ‘Ubaidullâh towards the gathering of idolaters around the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] — when there were only some Helpers with him — Jabir said: \"When the\nidolaters reached him, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: ‘Who will suffice us their\nevils (i.e. fight them back)?’ Talha said: ‘I will.’\" Then Jabir mentioned the advance\nof the Helpers to fight and how they were killed one after the other in a similar way\nto Muslim’s narration — \"When all the Helpers were killed, Talha proceeded forward\nto fight as much as the other eleven ones did till his hand was hurt and his fingers\nwere cut off. So he said: ‘Be they cut off!’ The Prophet [pbuh] said: ‘If you had said:\nIn the Name of Allâh, the angels would have raised you up before the people’s very\neyes.’\" Then he said: \"Allâh drove the idolaters off them.\"[Fath-al-Bari 7/361; An-Nasa'i 2/52,53]\nIn \tAl- Ikleel \t— a book by Hakim — it is stated that Talha had sustained thirty- nine or\nthirty- five wounds, and his fingers (i.e. the forefinger and the one next to it — got\nparalyzed. [ibid 7/361]\nIn a version by Qais bin Abi Hâzim — authorized by Al- Bukhari, he said: \"I saw the\nhand of Talha paralyzed. That was because he protected the Prophet [pbuh] with it\nin Uhud Battle.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/527, 2/581]\nAt- Tirmidhi stated that the Prophet [pbuh] then said about Talha: \"He who desires to\nsee a martyr walking on the ground, let him look at Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh.\" \t[Mishkat 2/566;\nIbn Hisham 2/86]\nAbu Da’ûd At- Tayalisi on the authority of ‘Aishah [R], said: \"Whenever Uhud Day\n(i.e. battle) was mentioned, Abu Bakr used to say: ‘That was Talha’s day (i.e.\nbattle)’. [Fath Al-Bari 7/361] \tAbu Bakr recited a verse of poetry about him: ‘O Talha bin\n‘Ubaidullâh! Paradise is due to you as water- springs are due to deer to drink out of.’\n[Mukhtasar Tareekh Damishq, 7/82] \tAt the awkward and most delicate circumstances, Allâh,\nGlory is to Him, sent down His invisible Help. In a version by Sa‘d — cleared and\nauthorized in \tSahih Al- Bukhari \tand \tMuslim \t— he said: \"I saw the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] on Uhud Day with two men — dressed in white defending him fiercely — I\nhave never seen similar to them neither before Uhud nor after it.\" In another\nversion: \"He means to say that they were Gabriel and Michael\". [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/580]\nAll those events happened in no time. If the Prophet [pbuh]’s elite Companions had\nrealized the grave situation immediately, they would have rushed on the spot and\nwould not have left him sustain these wounds. Unfortunately, they got there after\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had been wounded and six of the Helpers killed, the\nseventh was staggering under the brunt of wounds and desperately militating in\ndefence of the Prophet [pbuh]. However as soon as they arrived they encircled the\nMessenger with their bodies and weapons and were alert enough to prevent the\nenemies from reaching him. The first one who returned to give help, was his\ncavemate Abu Bakr As- Siddiq [R].\n\n-- 171 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n172\nIn a version by ‘Aishah [R] recorded in Ibn Hibban’s \tSahih, she narrated that Abu\nBakr had said:\n\"When it was Uhud Day and at the time that the Prophet [pbuh] was left behind, I\nwas the first to go back and see him. Before him I saw a man fighting to shield him\nfrom the enemies. I said to myself: ‘I wish he were Talha. Let my father and mother\nbe sacrificed for you. (O Allâh) Let him be Talha! Let my parents be sacrificed for\nyou!’ On the way, I was overtaken by Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah, who was then\nmoving as swiftly as a bird. We both rushed to dress the Prophet [pbuh]’s wounds.\nThere we found Talha suffering from serious wounds before the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]. The Prophet [pbuh] said: ‘See to your brother. His deed entitled him for an\nabode in Paradise.’ I noticed that two rings of the iron- ringed helmet had penetrated\nhis cheek. So I set out to take them out; but Abu ‘Ubaidah demanded: ‘By Allâh, O\nAbu Bakr — I beseech you, let me do it myself.’ Fearing to hurt the Prophet [pbuh]\nhe started pulling one of the two rings out very slowly and carefully with his mouth.\nThen he pulled the arrow out by his mouth, too. Consequently, his front tooth fell.\nThen I proceeded to pull the second out; but Abu ‘Ubaidah besought me to leave it:\n‘O, Abu Bakr, I adjure you by Allâh to let me do it.’ He pulled the second ring very\nslowly and carefully with his mouth — till it came out. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nsaid: ‘See to your brother. He has proved to be worthy of being housed in Paradise.’\nWe approached Talha to cure him but found out that he had had some ten sword-\nstrokes in his body. \t[Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/95] \t(This showed how efficiently Talha had fought\nand struggled on that day).\"\nAt those awkward moments of that day, a group of Muslim heroes gathered around\nthe Prophet [pbuh] forming a shield to protect him from the idolaters. Some of them\nwere Abu Dujana, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Sahl bin Haneef, Malik bin —\nSinan the father of Abu Sa‘îd Al- Khudri, Umm‘Amara, Nusaiba bint Ka‘b Al- Mâziniya,\nQatada bin An- Nu‘man, ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, Hatib bin Abi Balta‘a and Abu Talha.\nThe number of idolaters was steadily increasing; and their attacks, naturally, got\nseverer. Their press had increased to an extent that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nfell into one of the holes dug and designed by Abu ‘Amir Al- Fasiq to be used as traps.\nHis knee scratched and ‘Ali helped him by grasping his hand up. Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh\ntook him in his lap till he could stand upright. Nafi‘ bin Jubair said: I heard an\nEmigrant say: \"I have witnessed Uhud Battle and watched how arrows had been\nhurled from all directions at the Prophet [pbuh]. None of them however hit him.\n‘Abdullah, bin Shihab Az- Zuhri said: ‘Guide me to Muhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, If I\ndidn’t kill him, I would not hope to live.’ Although the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was\nnext to him, alone — but he did not observe him. Safwan, a co- polytheist of his,\nblamed him (for not translating his words into deeds), but ‘Abdullah swore that he\ndid not see him (the Prophet [pbuh]) and added that he might be immune to our\nattempts on his life. He also said that four of them pledged to make a fresh attempt\nand kill him, but also to no avail. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97]\nThe Muslims showed unprecedented rare heroism and marvellous sacrifices. Abu\nTalha — for instance — shielded the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] by his body and used\nhis chest to protect him against the enemy arrows. Anas related that on Uhud Day\nwhen people dispersed off the Prophet [pbuh], Abu Talhah was a skillful sort of\narcher who would pull arrows so much that he broke two or three bows that day.\nWhen a man passed along with a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet [pbuh] would\nsay: \"Spread the arrows to Abu Talhah!\" Then when the Prophet [pbuh] watched\n\n-- 172 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n173\npeople shooting, Abu Talhah would say: \"I sacrifice my father and mother for your\nsafety. Do not go too close lest an arrow of theirs should hit you. I would rather die\nthan see you hurt.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/581]\nAbu Dujana stood before the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and used to protect him\nfrom the arrows by his back. Hatib bin Balta‘a followed ‘Utbah bin Abi Waqqas — who\nbroke the honourable incisor (of the Prophet [pbuh]) — struck him with the sword,\ncracked his head and took his mare and sword. Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas was so keen to\nkill his brother ‘Utbah, but he could not; however, Hatib could.\nSahl bin Haneef — a hero archer — who had pledged to die in the cause of Allâh,\nalso played a prominent part in Uhud hostilities.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself was involved in shooting arrows. In a version\nby Qatadah bin An- Nu‘man that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] shot so many arrows\nthat the two ends of his bow were flattened. So Qatadah bin An- Nu‘man took it to\nremain with him for good. On that day his eye was so hurt that it fell down onto his\ncheek; but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reput it in its socket with his hand and it\nbecame the better and the more sharp- sighted of the two.\nOn that day ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf kept on fighting till his mouth was hurt and got\nbroken. He sustained over twenty wounds, some in his leg, and that lamed him.\nMalik bin Sinan, the father of Abi Sa‘eed Al- Khudri sucked the blood out of the\nProphet [pbuh]’s cheek till he cleaned it. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Spit it!\". But\nMalik said: \"By Allâh, I will never spit it\". Then he set out to fight. The Prophet\n[pbuh] then said: \"He who wants to see a man of the people of Paradise, let him look\nat this one.\" No sooner had he resumed fighting than he was martyred in the thick of\nthe battle.\nUmm ‘Amarah participated in the fight too. She encountered Ibn Qami’a in combat,\nand sustained a slight wound on her shoulder, but she herself also struck him with\nher sword several times but he survived because he was wearing two armours. She,\nhowever, went on striking until her wounds counted twelve.\nMus‘ab bin ‘Umair, in his turn, fought fiercely and violently defending the Prophet\n[pbuh] against the attacks of Ibn Qami’a and his fellows. He was carrying the\nstandard with his right hand. In the process of fighting, it was cut off, so he grabbed\nthe standard in his left hand till this was also amputated so he knelt down and\nshielded it with his chest and neck. Ibn Qami’a then killed him, mistaking him for the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] on account of resemblance in appearance. Only then did\nIbn Qami’a shout ‘Muhammad [pbuh] has been killed.’ [Ibn Hisham 2/73; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97]\nNo sooner had Ibn Qami’a uttered that ominous sentence than consternation spread\namong Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers, and their morale was drastically reduced.\nConsequently, confusion and a miserable state of disorder prevailed amongst them.\nWhilst the rumours managed to adversely act amongst the Muslims, it alleviated the\nsharp impact of the assaults of the polytheists who came to believe that they did\nreally achieve their final objective and so they turned towards mutilating the dead\nbodies.\n\n-- 173 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n174\nWhen Mus‘ab was killed, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] delivered the standard to ‘Ali\nbin Abi Talib. ‘Ali, in conjunction with the other Companions, went on fighting bravely\nand set marvellous examples of heroism, courage and endurance in both defence\nand attack.\nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made his way to his encircled army. Ka‘b bin\nMalik, who was the first one to recognize the approaching Prophet [pbuh], shouted\nas loudly as he could: \"O folks of Muslims, be cherished! The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] is here.\" But the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] signed to him to stop lest his\nposition should be located by the idolaters. Upon hearing the shout, the Muslims\nimmediately raced towards the source of the shout which brought about thirty\nCompanions to gather around the Prophet [pbuh]. With this assembled number of his\nCompanions, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started drawing a planned withdrawal to\nthe hillocks nearby.\nHostilities of the enemy grew fiercer than ever with the aim of foiling the plan of\nwithdrawal of the Muslims. Their attempts however proved to be fruitless due to the\nheroic steadfastness of the lions of Islam.\n‘Uthman bin ‘Abdullah bin Al- Mugheerah — one of the enemy horsemen —\nprogressed towards the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] while saying: \"Either I kill him\n(i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]) or I will be killed.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] moved to\nencounter him but his mare tripped into some holes. So Al- Harith bin As- Simma\ncombated with the enemy, and struck him on his leg so he went lame, then he\nfinished him off, took his arm and overtook the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\nBut later on another Makkan horseman, called ‘Abdullah bin Jabir, attacked Al- Harith\nbin As- Simma, and struck him on the shoulder with his sword and he was carried to\nthe camp of the Muslims suffering from serious wounds. Anyway that very idolater\ndid not escape death, for Abu Dujana — the red head- banded hero and adventurer —\nstruck him heavily and cut his head off.\nDuring this bitter fight, a desire to sleep overwhelmed the Muslims — that was a\nsecurity and tranquillity to help His slave Muslims as the Qur’ân spoke in this\ncontext. Abu Talhah said: \"I was one of those who were possessed by a desire to\nsleep on Uhud Day. On that day my sword fell off my hand several times. Again and\nagain it fell down and again and again I picked it up.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/582]\nIn a regular withdrawal and with great bravery and boldness, the Muslims finally\nretreated to the cover of Mountain Uhud. Then, the rest of the army followed them to\nthat safe position. In this manner, the genius of Muhammad [pbuh] foiled that of\nKhalid bin Al- Waleed.\nIbn Ishaq related that: \"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was going up the\nhillock, he was followed by Ubai bin Khalaf who was saying: ‘Where is Muhammad\n[pbuh]? Either I kill him or I will be killed.’ The Companions of Muhammad [pbuh]\nsaid: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, do you mind if one of us combats with him?’ But the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: ‘Leave him!’ So when he drew nearer, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] took the spear from Al- Harith bin As- Simma. He shivered\nviolently in such a way that made all of them scatter in all directions violently and\nimpulsively. Then he faced him, observed his clavicle through a gap between the\nwide opening of the armour and the part of his neck enclosed by. He speared him in\n\n-- 174 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n175\nthat spot. The effect of the stroke was so strong that it made him roll off his hor",
  "se\nover and over. When he returned to Quraish, they found that he had only had a\nsmall scratch in his neck. So when blood became congested he said: ‘By Allâh,\nMuhammad has killed me.’ Hearing him say so, they said: ‘By Allâh you are afraid to\ndeath. By Allâh, you are possessed by a devil.’ He replied: ‘He had already told me\nwhen we were in Makkah: ‘I will kill you.’ By Allâh, had he spate on me, he would\nhave killed me.’ Eventually, the enemy of Allâh breathed his last at a place called\nSarif, while they were taking him back to Makkah.\"[Ibn Hisham 2/84; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] \tIn a\nversion by Abul- Aswad, on the authority of ‘Urwa: He was lowing like a bull and\nsaying: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if (the pain) I am suffering from now\nwere distributed among the people of Al- Majaz, it would cause them to die.\" [Mukhtasar\nSeerat Ar-Rasool p.250]\nDuring the withdrawal of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] up to the cover of the\nmountain, a big rock blocked his way. The Prophet [pbuh] tried to mount it, but\nhaving worn a short heavy armour, and being seriously wounded — he could not\nascend it. Readily enough Talha sat in a position that enabled the Prophet [pbuh] to\nstand on his back. Then he lifted him up till he stood on it. The Prophet [pbuh] then\nsaid: \"Talha, after this job, is eligible for the Garden (Paradise).\" [Ibn Hisham 2/86]\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] settled down in his head quarters in the hillock,\nthe idolaters started their last attack upon the Muslims. Ibn Ishaq related that:\n\"While the Prophet [pbuh] was on the way to the hillock, a group of Quraishite elite\nascended the mountain. They were led by Khalid bin Al- Waleed and Abu Sufyan. So\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implored his Lord saying: ‘O Allâh, they (i.e. the\nidolaters) should not be higher (i.e. in position or in power) than us (i.e. the\nMuslims). Therefore ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab and some of the Emigrants fought the\nidolaters till they drove them down the mountain. [Ibn Hisham 2/86]\nIn \tAl- Maghazi \t— a book by Al- Umawi — it is stated that the idolaters went up the\nmountain. So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to Sa‘d: \"Drive them off.\" \"How can\nI drive them off by myself (i.e. without anyone to assist).\" But the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] repeated the phrase three times. Sa‘d then took an arrow out of his\nquiver, shot it at one of them and killed him. He said: \"Then I took another one I\nknow (to be good) and I shot with it another man. Then I took a third I know and\nkilled a third one. Consequently they climbed down the mountain. I said to myself,\n‘this must be a blessed arrow.’ I put it in my quiver.\" He kept it with him till he died.\nHis children kept it with them ever after. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/95]\nMutilation of the Martyrs\nThat was the last attack made by the idolaters against the Prophet [pbuh]. Being\nalmost certain of his death, the idolaters returned to their camp and started\npreparations to go back to Makkah. Some of them involved themselves in mutilating\nthe killed Muslims, and so did their women. Women and men cut off the ears, the\nnoses, the genitals of the martyrs. They even cut open their bellies. Hind bin ‘Utbah\n— for instance — ripped open the liver of Hamzah and chewed it; but finding it\nunpleasant, she spat it out. She even made the ears and noses of Muslims into\nanklets and necklaces. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/90]\nTwo incidents occurred during the last hours of the fight. Which revealed for certain\nhow far the Muslims were ready to fight and sacrifice in the way of Allâh:\n\n-- 175 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n176\n1. \tKa‘b bin Malik said: I was one of those Muslims who fought in Uhud and\nwitnessed the polytheists’ act of barbarity in mutilating the dead bodies, but I\npassed them because I couldn’t stand it. Then I saw an armed stout idolater\npass through the Muslims and say: \"Gather them up and combine them in the\nway that sheep are gathered and slaughtered.\" Similarly I saw an armed\nMuslim waiting for him. I walked towards them till I stood behind him.\nComparing both of them, I found that the disbeliever was better than the\nother in arms and figure. I kept on watching them till they were engaged in\nsingle combat. The Muslim thrust at the disbeliever with his sword that went\ndown his hip and split it into two. When the Muslim unveiled his face, he said:\n\"What about that, Ka‘b. I am Abu Dujana.\" \t[Al-Bidaya wan Nihaya 4/17]\n2. \tSome Muslim women came to the battlefield when the fight was over. Anas\nsaid: I saw ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr [R] with Umm Sulaim. Their garments were\ngathered up so I could see their anklets. They carried water bags on their\nshoulders and emptied them into the mouths of people. \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/403,\n2/581] \tThen they would go back to fill them and come back to do the same.\n‘Umar said: \"Umm Saleet used to carry water bags to us on Uhud Day.\" \t[ibid\n1/401]\nWhen Umm Aiman, who was one of those Muslim women who saw the defeated\nMuslim fighters entering Madinah, she started throwing dust at their faces rebukingly\nsaying: \"Here is a spinning wheel, take it! and give up carrying swords.\" Then she\nraced to the battlefield. There she watered the wounded. Hibban bin Al- ‘Arqa shot an\narrow at her, she fell down and her clothes were lifted up. Seeing that, the enemy of\nAllâh, burst into laughter. That sight upset the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], so he\ngave Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas an arrow lacking an arrow- head and said \"Shoot it\". Sa‘d\nshot it, it pierced the idolater’s throat. He fell down and some parts of his body were\nrevealed. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then laughed so much that his molars could\nbe seen. Sa‘d avenged her and Allâh responded to her supplication. \t[As-Seerat Al-Halabiyah\n2/22]\nAs soon as the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reached the defile, ‘Ali bin Abu Talib went\nout and filled his water container with water from \tAl- Mihras. ‘Al- Mihras’ is said to be\nhollow (concaved) rock containing plenty of water. It was also said that it is a water\nspring in Uhud mountain. Anyway, ‘Ali brought that water to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] to drink. Finding that it smelt bad he refused to drink it, but only washed the\nblood off his face and poured some of it over his head saying: Allâh’s Wrath is great\non those who besmeared His Messenger’s face with blood. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/85]\nSahl said: \"By Allâh, I know who washed the wound of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nand who poured out water for him and what (substances) his wound was treated\nwith: His daughter Fatimah washed it, whereas ‘Ali poured water out of the\ncontainer. When Fatimah realized that water increased the flow of blood, she took a\npiece of straw mat, burnt it a little and stuck it to the wound so blood ceased\nflowing.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/584]\nMuhammad bin Maslamah brought him fresh water to drink. The Prophet [pbuh]\ndrank and supplicated Allâh to provide him with good things. \t[As- Seerat Al- Halabiyah 2/30]\nOwing to the wounds and their bad effects on his body, the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] led his followers in prayer in a sitting posture and so did the Muslims. \t[Ibn Hisham\n2/87]\n\n-- 176 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n177\nWhen the preparations of the idolaters for departure came to an end, Abu Sufyan\nwent up the mountain and called out: \"Is Muhammad [pbuh] among you?\" They did\nnot answer him. Then he asked \"Is Ibn Abi Quhafah (i.e. Abu Bakr) among you?\"\nThey did not answer. He asked again: \"Is ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab among you?\" They\ndid not answer him; for the Prophet [pbuh] forbade them answering him. He only\nasked about those three. That is because he and his people knew quite well that the\ncall to Islam depended to a large degree on those men. Abu Sufyan then said: \"As\nfor those three, we have relieved you of.\" ‘Umar could not help but talking, so he\nsaid, \"O enemy of Allâh, those whom you have just mentioned, I tell you that they\nare still alive. Allâh has maintained what you hate.\" Abu Sufyan answered: \"The\nmutilation of your killed is something I did not order it; but it did not displease me.\"\nThen he shouted: \"Hubal (an idol), let it be sublime!\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Why\ndo you not reply?\" \"What shall we say?\" They asked him. \"Say: Allâh is more\nSublime and Exalted and Mightier as well.\"\nHe said: \"Al- ‘Uzza (i.e. an idol) is ours but you have no ‘Uzza.\" \"Why do you not\nreply?\" The Prophet [pbuh] said. \"What shall we say?\" They inquired. He said: \"Say\nAllâh is our Protector, but you have no protector.\"\nAbu Sufyan said: \"Well deeds! Today is a vengeance for Badr Day. This for that. War\nis attended with alternate success.\" ‘Umar’s reply was: \"No. They are not the same.\nOur killed men are housed in Paradise; but yours are in Fire.\"\nThen Abu Sufyan said: \"Come on, ‘Umar!\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Go\nand see what the matter is.\" He went there. Abu Sufyan asked him: \"I beseech you\nby Allâh’s Name to tell me the truth: Have we killed Muhammad [pbuh]?\" ‘Umar\nsaid: \"O Allâh, ‘No’ and now he is listening to you words.\" He said: \"For me, you are\nmore truthful than Ibn Qami’a, and even more reliable.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/93,94; Za'd Al- Ma'ad\n2/94; Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/579]\nIbn Ishaq said: When Abu Sufyan and those who were with him were leaving he\ncalled out notifying: \"We will meet again at Badr next year.\" The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] said to one of his men: \"Say: ‘Yes, it is an appointment for both of us.’\" \t[Ibn\nHisham 2/94]\nLater on, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dispatched ‘Ali bin Abi Talib to trace them\nout. He said to him: \"Pursue them and see what they are going to do, and what they\naim at. If they dismount horses and ride on camels’ back, this means that they are\nheading for Makkah; but if they ride horses and lead camels unmounted, they are\nleaving for Madinah. By the One, in Whose Hand my soul is, if they attacked Madinah\nI would march to them there and I would fight them.\" ‘Ali said: \"I went out and\ntraced them to see what they were up to. I saw them mounting camels and leaving\nthe horses unmounted. They were heading for Makkah.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/94]\nAfter the departure of the Quraishites, people went out to check the identity of the\nkilled and the wounded. Zaid bin Thabit said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent\nme on Uhud Day to seek Sa‘d bin Ar- Rabî‘ and said: \"When you see him, say: ‘peace\nbe upon you from me.’ and say to him ‘the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] says: How do\nyou feel?’\" Zaid said: \"I started wandering about checking the killed till I came across\nSa‘d when he was dying — with about seventy strokes or stabs of a sword, a spear\nand an arrow in his body.So I said: \"O Sa‘d, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sends\nyou his greetings. and says ‘peace be upon you, tell me how do you feel?’\" Sa‘d said:\n\n-- 177 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n178\n\"And let peace be upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], too. Tell him, I smell the\nscent of the Paradise. And tell the Helpers, my people, ‘you shall not be excused\nbefore Allâh if the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] is hurt and your eyes are blinking’ (i.e.\nyou are still alive and not dead).\" Then he died. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/96]\nThey came across Al- Usairim — ‘Amr bin Thabit, whom they had already urged to\nembrace Islam but refused. They saw him among the wounded on the verge of close\ndeath. \"What has he come here for? We have parted with him and he was still too\nobdurate to accept Islam as his religion\". They asked him: \"What made you come\nhere? Is it out of zeal to defend your people or is it because of an inclination to\nIslam?\" He said: \"It is (certainly) an inclination to Islam. I believe in Allâh and in His\nMessenger. I have fought with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] till I have got what you\nsee,\" and then he immediately died. They told the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] about\nhim. Hearing that, he said: \"He is one of the inhabitants of Paradise.\" \"Although he\nhad not offered one single prayer,\" narrated Abu Hurairah. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/94; Ibn Hisham 2/90]\nQazman, who was found among the wounded, fought heroically, and killed seven or\neight idolaters. He was weakened by the wounds he had sustained, they carried him\nto the habitation of Bani Zufr. The Muslims gave him glad tidings of the Paradise. But\nhe said: \"By Allâh I have fought out of a zeal to my people. Had it not been for that I\nwould have never fought.\" When his wounds worsened he committed suicide. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] had already said whenever he was mentioned to him: \"He\nis an inhabitant of Fire.\" \t[Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/97; Ibn Hisham 2/88] \tThis is the end of those who\nfight for a national cause or in a way other than that of raising up the Word of Allâh,\nthough they fought under the banner of Islam or even in the army of the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] or of his Companions.\nContrary to Qazman there was a Jew of Bani Tha‘labah among the killed. He said to\nhis people, \"O folk people of Jews! By Allâh you have already known that it is\nimperative to support Muhammad [pbuh].\" They said: \"Today is Saturday.\" He said:\n\"There is no Saturday for you.\" He took his sword and the war equipment and said:\n\"If I were killed, my property should be put at Muhammad [pbuh]’s disposal\". Then\nnext morning he kept on fighting till he was killed. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nsaid about him, \"Mukhaireeq is the best Jew.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/88,89]\nBurial of the Martyrs\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] supervised the martyrs’ burial and said: \"I bear\nwitness that anyone who is wounded in the way of Allâh, Allâh will resurrect him with\nhis wound bleeding a liquid which is blood- like in colour but musk- like in scent.\" \t[Ibn\nHisham 2/98]\nSome of the Companions carried their men killed in the war to Madinah, but the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered that they should be sent back in order to be\nburied where they were killed. He ordered that they should not be washed but buried\nas they were after stripping them off their armours and leather clothes. He used to\nbury every two or three martyrs together in one grave and even join two men in one\ngarment while saying: \"Who is the more learned of the Qur’ân?\" and he would\ncommit him to earth first. He would say: \"I bear witness to those on the Day of\nResurrection.\" He buried both ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Haram and ‘Amr bin Al- Jamuh\nin one grave due to the affection they used to possess to each other. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/98;\nSahih Al-Bukhari 2/584]\n\n-- 178 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n179\nThey missed the coffin of Hanzalah, they sought it and found that it was on a spot\nnearby with water dripping off it. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told his Companions\nthat the angels were washing him and said: \"Ask his wife\". They asked her and she\nconfirmed that he had been in a state of ceremonial impurity. That was why\nHanzalah was called ‘Ghaseel Al- Malâ’ikah’ (i.e. the one washed by the angels). \t[Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 2/94]\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] saw how his uncle and foster brother, Hamzah,\nwas mutilated, he was extremely grieved. When his aunt Safiyah came to see her\nbrother Hamzah, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered her son Az- Zubair to dismiss\nher in order not to see what happened to her brother. She refused and said, \"But\nwhy should I go away. I have been informed that they have mutilated him. But so\nlong as it is in the way of Allâh, whatever happens to him satisfies us. I say: Allâh is\nSufficient and I will be patient if Allâh wills.\" She approached, looked at him and\nsupplicated Allâh for him and said: \"To Allâh we all belong and to Him we will verily\nreturn.\" and she implored Allâh to forgive him. Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nordered that he should be buried with ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh — who was his nephew as\nwell as his foster brother.\nIbn Mas‘ud said: We have never seen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] weeping so\nmuch as he was for Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib. He directed him towards \tAl- Qiblah,\nthen he stood at his funeral and sobbed his heart out. \t[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.255]\nThe sight of the martyrs was extremely horrible and heart- breaking. Describing\nHamzah’s funeral, Khabbab said: \"No shroud long enough was available for Hamzah\nexcept a white- darkish garment. When they covered his head with it, it was too short\nto cover his feet. Similarly if they covered his feet his head would be revealed.\nFinally they covered his head with it and put some plant called ‘Al- Idhkhir’ to cover\nhis feet.\" \t[Mishkat 1/140]\nAl- Imam Ahmad reported that when it was Uhud Day and the time that the idolaters\nreturned, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said:\n\" \tIstawoo \t(i.e. form rows as for prayer) so that I offer thanks and praise to\nmy Lord, the Great and the All- Mighty.\"\nSo they stood in rows behind him. Then he said:\n\"O Allâh, no one can withhold what You permit or permit what You\nwithhold. No one can guide whom You decree to go astray or make go\nastray the one whom You guide. No one can grant provisions you have\nwithheld and no one can withhold what you grant. No one can near what\nYou ordained to be distant, or detach what You decree to be close. O Allâh,\nspread onto all of us Your Mercy, Your Grace, and Provisions.\"\n\"O Allâh, I implore You to grant me permanent bliss that neither changes\nnor vanishes. O Allâh, You Alone we seek for Help at hardships. You Alone\nwe resort to for security on a day of terror. O Allâh, to You Alone I resort to\nprotect us from the evils of Your grants (i.e. the evils they may lead us to)\nand from the evils of Your deprivation. O Allâh, make us love Faith and make\nit pleasant and beloved wholeheartedly by us! Make disbelief, ungodliness\nand disobedience detestable to us. Let us be among those who are rightly\n\n-- 179 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n180\nguided. O Allâh, make us live as Muslims and cause us to die as Muslims;\nand make us join with the righteous but not with the disgraced and misled\nones. O Allâh, make Your enmity befall the disbelievers, who belie Your\nMessenger and divert from Your righteous way. O Allâh, let Your wrath,\nYour chastisement and Your enmity befall the disbelievers, and those on\nwhom You sent down the Book. Let them be afflicted with war decreed by\nYou. O Allâh, the Author of Truth.\" \t[Musnad Imam Ahmad 3/424]\nAfter committing all the martyrs to earth, and after offering praise and supplication\nto Allâh, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] went back to Madinah.\nOn his way back, matchless examples of love and devotion were revealed by the\ntruthful women believers; in no way less great than the men’s heroic deeds in the\nfight.\nHamnah bint Jahsh met the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on the way back, and he\nannounced the death of her brother — ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh — to her. She said: \"To\nAllâh we belong and to Him we will verily return. I ask Allâh’s forgiveness.\" Then he\nannounced the death of her maternal uncle Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib. She said:\n\"To Allâh we belong and to Him we will verily return. I ask Allâh’s forgiveness.\" But\nwhen he announced the death of her husband Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair to her, she shouted\nand woed. Seeing her doing so, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"The woman’s\nhusband is extremely dear to her.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/98]\nHe passed by a woman of Bani Dinar whose husband, father and brother were all\nkilled at Uhud. When their death announced, she said: \"How is the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] ?\" They said: \"Well indeed. O mother of so... Thanks for Allâh; he is\nwell and as good as you desire.\" She said: \"Let me see him.\" They pointed at him.\nSeeing him she said: \"All misfortunes are nothing so long as you are safe.\" \t[Ibn Hisham\n2/99]\nUmm Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh came running to see the Prophet [pbuh]. At that time her son\nwas holding the rein of his mare. Seeing his mother, he said to the Prophet [pbuh]:\n\"O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. This is my mother.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"She is\nwelcome\"; and he stopped and waited for her. When she drew near, he consoled her,\nfor her killed son ‘Amr bin Mu‘adh. But she said: \"So long as I see you are safe, my\nmisfortune will certainly go into oblivion.\" Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nsupplicated Allâh for the relatives of those who were killed at Uhud and said: \"Cheer\nup! Umm Sa‘d and bear good tidings to their kindred that all their people killed in the\nbattle are comrades in Paradise and they are intercessors for all their kinsfolk.\" She\nreplied, \"O Messenger of Allâh, we are satisfied. Who would cry on them after this\ncheerful news?\" Then she resumed saying: \"O Messenger of Allâh, invoke Allâh (for\nthose who stayed behind)\" He said: \"O Allâh keep sorrow off their hearts! And\nconsole them with their misfortunes. Compensate those who stayed behind with\ngoodness and welfare.\" \t[As-Seerat Al-Halabiyah 2/47]\nIn the evening of that day — i.e. Saturday, the seventh of Shawwal, 3rd year A.H. —\nthe Messenger arrived in Madinah. As soon as he reached his house, he handed his\nsword to his daughter Fatimah and said: \"O daughter, wash the blood off this sword.\nBy Allâh it has been helpful to me today.\" ‘Ali bin Abi Talib handed her his sword and\nsaid: \"And wash the blood of this sword too. By Allâh, it has been helpful to me\n\n-- 180 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n181\ntoday.\" So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Sahl bin Haneef and Abu Dujana\nhave been as courageous as you are in the fight.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/100]\nMost of the narrations confirmed that seventy Muslims were killed and most of them,\nsixty- five, Helpers; forty- one of whom were from Khazraj and twenty- four from Aws.\nThis, besides one Jew and four Emigrants.\nAs for the polytheists, twenty- two of them were killed, but some versions speak of\nthirty- seven; after all, Allâh knows best. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/122-129; Fath Al-Bari 7/351]\nOn Saturday night, the eighth of Shawwal, and after their return from Uhud, the\nMuslims spent that night in an emergency case — though they were dead- beat,\nextremely exhausted. They stayed on the alert, and spent that night guarding the\noutlets and inlets of Madinah. They were specially busy guarding their general\nleader, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] for fear that some suspects could commit an\nunexpected folly.\nHamrâ’ Al-Asad Invasion\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his part, spent the night pondering over the\nsituation. He feared that the idolaters might think — while they were still on their\nway to Makkah — of reversing their way and diverting to Madinah after they had\nrealized that they had availed nothing of that victory. They might regret and decide\nto invade Madinah as a compensation. Therefore the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was\ndetermined to go out in pursuit of the Makkan army.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] called out unto people and ordered them to march to encounter\nthe enemy of Islam. That was on Sunday morning — next day to Uhud — the eighth\nof Shawwal. He said: \"Nobody will march to the fight except those who have already\nparticipated in Uhud fight.\" ‘Abdullah bin Ubai said: \"I will march out with you.\" \"No,\"\nsaid the Prophet [pbuh].\nWhilst the Muslims were suffering a lot from painful pains and deep anxiety, they\nresponded to his call positively. Jabir bin ‘Abdullah implored the Prophet [pbuh] to\nallow him join them in that fresh invasion on account that he always had a liking to\nwitness all the battles that the Prophet [pbuh] was involved in. He had not\nparticipated in Uhud because his father asked him to stay in Madinah with his sisters\n. And he was granted his wish.\nThe Muslims marched out until they reached a place called Hamra’ Al- Asad — about\neight miles from Madinah. He encamped there. In that place Ma‘bad bin Abi Ma‘bad\ncame to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and professed Islam. Some people said that\nhe remained an idolater; he simply desired to give the Messenger some advice out of\nabidance by a covenant between Khuza‘ah (his tribe) and Bani Hashim. He said \"O\nMuhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, we feel great sorrow for what had happened to you\nand to your Companions. We really hope you will not suffer again.\" So, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] suggested that he overtake Abu Sufyan and discourage\nhim from pursuing his evil intentions.\nThe Messenger’s fears of a possible return of the idolaters proved to be absolutely\ntrue. For no sooner had the idolaters dismounted and encamped at Ar- Rawhâ’ — a\n\n-- 181 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n182\nplace thirty- six miles from Madinah, than they started reproaching one another. A\ngroup of them said to another one: \"You did nothing. You broke down their force but\nyou left them. There are still some distinguished men among them who will probably\ngather people up to fight you again. So let us go back and annihilate them and crush\ndown their forces.\"\nIt was in fact a hasty decision taken by shallow- minded people who misjudged the\npotential power and morale on both parties, that is why an eminent leader of\nQuraish, Safwan bin Omaiyah, tried to dissuade his people from pursuing that\nventure, saying: \"O people. Do not do such a thing! For I fear that he will gather up\nthose who had stayed behind and did not share in Uhud. Go back home as winners.\nFor I am not sure of what turn will the consequences take if you get involved in such\na fight. It might be to your prejudice in the final place.\" Notwithstanding that\nweighty argument, the majority of the polytheists were determined to embark on\nthat risky undertaking.\nMa‘bad bin Abu Ma‘bad meanwhile arrived on the scene and tried to exaggerate the\ndanger awaiting them in order to thwart their plan, he said: \"Muhammad [pbuh] has\nmarched to meet you with a large host of fighters, I have never seen something\nsimilar to it before. He has mustered all the troops who have tarried and did not\nshare in Uhud. They surely regret what they have missed and want to compensate\nfor it now. Their hearts are filled with hate and resentment.\" Abu Sufyan said: \"Woe\nto you! What do you suggest?\" He said: \"By Allâh, I see that you would not leave till\nhe comes and you see the heads of their horses; or till the vanguard of his army\nturns up to you from behind that hill.\"\nAbu Sufyan said: \"By Allâh, we have reached a common consent to crush down the\nMuslims and their power.\" The man, once more with an implied warning, advised him\nto stop it.\nIn the light of this news, the resolution and determination of the Makkan army failed\nand panic and terror took firm hold of them. They consequently deemed it safest to\ncomplete there withdrawal back to Makkah. They, however, as an alternative,\nstarted a hostile nerve propaganda aiming at dissuading the Muslims army from\npursuing them. A caravan belonging to ‘Abd Qais happened to pass by towards\nMadinah. Abu Sufyan, in the context of his propaganda, asked them to communicate\na message to Muhammad [pbuh] to the effect that the Makkans had rallied their\nranks to annihilate the Messenger and his Companions, in return Abu Sufyan\npromised to give the people of the caravan loads of raisins at the forum of ‘Ukaz the\nfollowing year.\nThe people of the caravan conveyed the message to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nat Hamrâ’ Al- Asad, but to no effect, on the contrary, Abu Sufyan’s words augmented\nthem in Faith. Allâh says:\n\"… And they said: ‘Allâh (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best\nDisposer of affairs (for us). So they turned with Grace and Bounty from\nAllâh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allâh.\nAnd Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:173,174]\nAfter the arrival of the caravan on Sunday, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stayed at\nHamrâ’ Al- Asad for three days — Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday — 9- 11\n\n-- 182 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n183\nShawwal, 3 A.H. and then returned to Madinah. Before his return, he took Abu ‘Azza\nAl- Jumahi as a prisoner of war. Incidentally, this man had also been captured at Badr\nbut on account of his poverty, and the large family he supported, the Prophet [pbuh]\nhad been gracious enough to release him on condition that he would not involve\nhimself in war against the Muslims again. Abu ‘Azza did not keep his promise and\ntook part in Uhud hostilities on the side of the polytheists. Here again he implored\nMuhammad [pbuh] for pardon but the latter told him that a believer wouldn’t be\ntaken twice in the same snare. He then deservedly merited the sentence of death\nwhich was executed by Az- Zubair or, in another version, by ‘Asim bin Thabit.\nA Makkan spy, called Mu‘awiyah bin Al- Mugheerah bin Abi Al- ‘As, was sentenced to\ndeath too. This spy was the grandfather of ‘Abdul Malik bin Marwan on his mother\nside. When the idolaters went back after Uhud, Mu‘awiyah came to his paternal\ncousin ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan ÑÖì Çááå Úäå. ‘Uthman gave him shelter — after securing\nthe Prophet [pbuh]’s permission — on condition that if he was caught there after\nthree days, he would be killed. But he did not comply with it, so when the Muslim\narmy left Madinah, he stayed there for more than three days during which he was\nspying for Quraish. So when the army returned, Mu‘awiyah fled out of Madinah. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], on this account, ordered Zaid bin Harithah and ‘Ammar\nbin Yasir to pursue him and kill him. So he was killed. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/60-129; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91-108;\nFath Al-Bari 7/345-377; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.242-275]\nUndoubtedly, the invasion of Hamrâ’ Al- Asad is not a separate invasion, but rather a\npart, or more specifically, a sequel to Uhud.\nThat was Uhud Invasion with all its stages and details. It has for long been discussed\nby scholars and men of research. Was it a defeat or not? Doubtlessly, the military\nsuperiority in the second phase of the battle was in favour of the polytheists who\ncould successfully direct the steering mechanism of hostilities and inflict heavy losses\nin lives on the Muslims. Admittedly, a part of the believers were clearly defeated, but\nthis could never be considered a Makkan victory.\nThe Makkan army failed to occupy the camp of the Muslims. The greater bulk of the\nMadinese army, chaos and confusion notwithstanding, did not take to escape, on the\ncontrary they showed matchless and heroic resistance and managed to gather\nthemselves again around their headquarters fighting bravely and courageously.\nThey, moreover, did not allow the Makkans to run a",
  "fter them in pursuit. Neither\nMuslim captives were taken nor spoils were gained by the Makkans. The enemies of\nIslam were also too cowardly to conduct the third phase of war, and impress their\nsuperiority on the battlefield, on the contrary, they were in hot haste to evacuate the\nfield even before the Muslims did. Madinah itself, the capital of the Muslims, was only\na stone’s throw from the lines of the enemy, and vulnerably exposed, yet the\npolytheists were not bold enough to storm it to plunder its wealth or capture the\nMuslim women therein.\nThese suggestive details in fact support our argument that the event of Uhud was\njust a precious occasion on which the Makkans managed only to inflict heavy losses\non the Muslims but failed to achieve their ultimate goals of annihilating the Muslim\narmy in the process of their encompassment operation. After all, it is not unusual for\nconquerors to sustain such casualties and losses, but these could under no\ncircumstances be regarded as victory for the hostile party.\n\n-- 183 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n184\nThe incident of Hamrâ’ Al- Asad is interesting in this regard. It is a curious sight\nindeed of a victorious army in retreat for fear of disgrace and defeat, and the\ncrestfallen and crippled group of Muslims in pursuit.\nUhud Battle in the final judgement was just one phase of military activities in the\nwhole process of war between two hostile parties each of whom earned their\nlegitimate portion of both success and failure and then desisted further engagement\nbut without cowardly escape or resigned surrender. In this sense, this battle could be\nrightly regarded as an inseparable war.\nIn this context, Allâh says:\n\"And don’t be weak in the pursuit of the enemy; if you are suffering\n(hardships) then surely, they (too) are suffering (hardships) as you are\nsuffering, but you have a hope from Allâh (for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that\nfor which they hope not.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 4:104]\nThe verse explicitly identifies both attitudes as regards losses and hardships as\nidentical. Both parties concluded the war operations and went back neither victorious\nnor vanquished.\nThe Observations of the Noble Qur’ân on the Battle of Uhud\nSome Qur’ânic verses were revealed to shed light on the most decisive phases of the\nbattle successively, adduce quite clearly the cause that led to that heavy loss, and\nillustrate the vulnerable areas that were still persisting in the souls of some believers\nas regards their duties in forging a decisive attitude with respect to the noble\nobjectives for which the Muslim Community, was created and was supposed to\naccomplish.\nThe Noble Qur’ân also spoke about the attitude of the pretenders to Faith and made\nclear the hostility and hatred that they harboured against Allâh and His Messenger.\nThe Words of Allâh managed as well to erase all traces of ambiguities and\ninsinuations, raised by the hypocrites and their allies, the Jews — the authors of\nconspiracy and intrigue hatching — and which were still in active operation in the\nhearts of some weak- of- heart Muslims.\nThe laudable judgement and long- sought objectives that were attributable to the\nbattle of Uhud, were also another topic for the Noble Qur’ân to dwell on at length.\nSixty verses relevant to the battle were revealed giving full account of the first phase\nof the battle:\n\"And (remember) when you (Muhammad [pbuh]) left your household in the\nmorning to post the believers at their stations for the battle (of Uhud).\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 3:121]\nAnd to end in a comprehensive commentary on its results and moralities:\n\"Allâh will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He\ndistinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allâh disclose to you the\nsecrets of the \tGhaib \t(unseen), but Allâh chooses of His Messengers whom\n\n-- 184 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n185\nHe pleases. So believe in Allâh and His Messengers. And if you believe and\nfear Allâh, then for you there is a great reward.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:179]\nLessons and Moralities\nIbn Al- Qaiyim has made a pointed reference to the battle of Uhud and given full\nelucidation of the Divine benefits and moralities that resulted from it. Some Muslim\nscholars, on the authority of Ibn Hajar, said: The reverse in Uhud resulted from the\nneglect on the part of the archers of the explicit command of the Prophet [pbuh],\nand leaving the spot which they were ordered to safeguard to the end. In other\nwords, the success of the Muslims depends upon their obedience to the Prophet\n[pbuh]. As long as they carry out his behests, Allâh will help them in facing all kinds\nof odds. But when they will set aside his commands in their pursuit of worldly riches,\nthey are bound to come to grief. Another relevant issue of great significance says\nthat it is customary for Prophets to be tried with different adversities; nevertheless,\nthe final outcome is positively in their favour. Should the Muslims be victorious all\nthe time, great many pretenders to Faith will enter the fold of Islam, and\nconsequently the clear line of demarcation between true believers and hypocrites will\nbecome blurred. Contrarily, if the Muslims were to be defeated all the time, the final\nobjective of the ministry of Prophets will not be effected. It is wise then to combine\nboth success and failure so that sifting between true Muslims and hypocrites could be\nrealized.\nIn the aftermath of the battle of Uhud, the hypocrites disclosed their real intentions\nin words and in deeds, consequently, the Muslims got to realize the existence of\nthose wicked elements working secretly in their own homeland; and of course there\nwould be appropriate measures to be taken in due course of time.\nA third point in this context refers to purposeful deferment of victory in some areas\nin order to check the pride of the soul and teach the believers how to observe full\npatience in times of adversity. Trials and tests are provided by Allâh in order that the\ntrue believers could deservedly occupy their abode in the blessed Hereafter.\nMartyrdom, the highest ranks that the true friends of Allâh could occupy, is provided\nby Allâh to function as a passport, granted by the Lord, leading to Paradise. In brief,\nfight in the cause of Allâh is a golden opportunity for the true believers to have their\nsins effaced, and a Divinely- devised event for the disbelievers and enemies of Allâh\nto face destruction and annihilation in recompense for their disbelief, tyranny and\ntransgression. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/99- 108]\n\n-- 185 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n186\nMilitary Platoons and Missions between the Battle of Uhud and the Battle\nof the Confederates\nUhud’s misfortune left a bad impact on both the credibility and military reputation of\nthe Muslims. Their dignity and power in people’s eyes were impaired. Troubles and\ndangers spread everywhere in and out of Madinah. The Jews, hypocrites and\nbedouins declared publicly their enmity to the Muslims and each party was keen on\ndegrading and, in the final place, exterminating their whole existence.\nTwo months had almost passed after this battle, when Banu Asad made preparations\nto raid Madinah, ‘Udal and Qarah tribes conspired against\nthe Muslims in the month of Safar, 4 A.H. and killed ten of the Prophet [pbuh]’s\nCompanions. Similarly Banu ‘Amir plotted against them too, and seventy\nCompanions were killed in the battle of Ma‘una Well. During that period, Banu\nNadeer kept on announcing their enmity and were involved in a plot to kill the\nProphet Muhammad [pbuh] in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal in 4 A.H. Banu Ghatfan were about to\nattack Madinah in Jumada Al- Ula in 4 A.H.\nThus we see that the Muslims turned into an attractive target of several potential\ndangers after they had lost their military credibility in the battle of Uhud. Muhammad\n[pbuh] most wisely managed to hold all those hostile currents at bay, and even\nredeem the lost dignity of the Muslims and gain them anew fresh glory and noble\nstanding. The first initiative he took in this process was Hamra’ Al- Asad pursuit\noperation, whereby he could retain the Muslim military reputation. He succeeded in\nrecovering his followers’ dignity and awe- inspiring position in such a manner that\nastonished or even astounded both the Jews and hypocrites, alike, then he\nproceeded to crown his successful attempts by despatching military errands and\nmissions:\nAbi Salamah Mission\nThe first people to take up arms against the Muslims in the aftermath of Uhud\nreverse were Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah. \"The Intelligence Corps\" of Madinah\nreported that Talhah and Salamah, sons of Khuwailid have mustered some\nvolunteers to fight the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately\ndespatched a 150- man- platoon of Helpers and Emigrants headed by Abu Salamah.\nThe Muslim leader took Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah by surprise in their own homeland,\nneutralized their attempts, dispersed them and captured their cattle. On his return,\nAbu Salamah had an inflammation of a previous wound he sustained in Uhud, and\ncaused him to die soon after. This expedition took place on Muharram 1st, 4 A.H.[Za'd\nAl-Ma'ad 2/108]\nAn Errand led by ‘Abdullah bin Unais\nOn the fifth day of the same month Muharram, 4 A.H., it was reported that Khalid\nbin Sufyan Al- Hudhali was gathering some mob to raid the Muslim positions.\n‘Abdullah bin Unais, at the behest of the Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æ Óáã set out to\ndestroy the enemies.\nThe Muslim military leader stayed away for eighteen days during which he\nsuccessfully fulfilled his task, killed the head of the rebels and brought his head back\n\n-- 186 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n187\nto Madinah on Saturday, seven days before the end of Muharram. The Prophet\n[pbuh], as a reward, gave him a stick saying \"This will function as a sign of\nrecognition for you and me on the Day of Resurrection.\" On his death bed, ‘Abdullah\nrequested that the log be with him in his shroud. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/109; Ibn Hisham 2/619, 620]\nThe Event of Ar-Raji‘\nIn Safar of the fourth year A.H., a delegation from the tribes of ‘Udal and Qarah\ncame to Madinah and asked the Prophet [pbuh] to send a group of Companions to\ninstruct them in religion, claiming the existence of some Muslims among them. He\nsent six of his Companions, in another version, ten headed by Murthid bin Abi\nMurthid Al- Ghanawi, or, according to Al- Bukhari, ‘Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of\n‘Asim bin ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab. When they reached a spot called Ar- Raji‘ between\nRabigh and Jeddah, a hundred archers of Banu Lihyan clan surrounded the place and\nattacked them. The delegation of Muslims took shelter on some high ground, Fudfud,\nand the bedouins offered them a pledge that they would not be killed. ‘Asim refused\nto come down, instead he fought them until he and six of his companions were\nkilled. Three men were left, Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad- Dathna and another one. Once\nagain, the bedouins offered them a guarantee of safety and they accepted. When\nthey descended, the bedouins treacherously bound them. The third man rebuked\nthem for their insincerity and resisted them so they killed him. The other two men\nwho had killed some notables of Quraish at Badr were taken and sold in Makkah. The\nfirst was Khubaib who was detained for some time and then it was unanimously\ndecided to crucify him. He was taken from the Holy Sanctuary to At- Tan‘im for\ncrucifixion. He requested a respite to offer a two- \tRak‘a \tprayer. After the final\ngreeting, he turned to his executioners, and said: \"Had I not been afraid that you\nwould think that I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a long time.\" It was\nthen that Khubaib first set the tradition of praying two \tRak‘a \tbefore being executed.\nHe then said:\n\"O Lord! Count them one by one, exterminate them to the last one.\"\nHe then recited some verses of poetry which speak eloquently of the atrocities borne\nby him, and testify to his Faith in Allâh at this hour of suffering:\nThe confederates have gathered their tribes around me,\nAnd summoned all of them who could come.\nThey have gathered their women and children,\nI am bound fastly to a lofty trunk.\nTo Allâh alone I complain of my helplessness and sufferings,\nAnd of the death, the confederates have prepared for me.\nLord of the Throne! Give me endurance against their design,\nThey have cut my flesh bit by bit, and I have been deprived of sustenance.\nThey let me choose infidelity but death is preferable,\nTears roll out of my eyes, though not of fear.\nBy Allâh! I fear not if I die a Muslim,\nOn what side I fall for the sake of Allâh.\nI will not show subservience to the enemy,\nIf Lord so desires, He will bless my torn limbs and broken joints.\nAbu Sufyan then addressed him saying: \"I adjure you by Allâh, don’t you wish that\nMuhammad [pbuh] were here in your place so that we might cut off his head, and\n\n-- 187 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n188\nthat you were with your family?\" Khubaib answered, \"By Allâh, I do not wish that\nMuhammad [pbuh] now were in the place I occupy or that a thorn could hurt him,\nand that I were sitting with my family.\" Quraish ordered ‘Uqbah bin Al- Harith, whose\nfather had been killed by Khubaib himself, to crucify him. They also appointed\nsomeone to guard his corpse. ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad- Damari played a cunning trick\nand carried the corpse stealthily at night to bury it somewhere. It was later reported\nthat shortly before his crucifixion, he was seen eating a bunch of grapes although\nthere was not even one date available in Makkah at that time. [In fact, it was\nnothing but sustenance bestowed upon him by Allâh.]\nSafwan bin Omaiyah purchased the second man, Zaid bin Ad- Dathna, and killed him\nas an act of vengeance for his father’s murder.\nQuraish, whom ‘Asim had killed one of their notables, sent someone to fetch a\nportion of his body, but to their disappointment, his corpse was inaccessible because\na large swarm of hornets had been shielding him against any malicious tampering.\n‘Asim had already given his Lord a pledge to remain immune against any polytheist\ntampering with respect to his body, and also stay detached from any contact with\nthe enemies of Allâh. ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, when hearing this piece of news\nexclaimed, \"Allâh verily protects His believing slave after death just as He does\nduring his lifespan.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/169-179; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/109; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/568,569,585]\nThe Tragedy of Ma‘una Well\nMa‘una Well tragedy, which was even more horrible than that of Ar- Raji‘, took place\nin the same month.\nAbu Bara’ — ‘Amir bin Malik — nicknamed ‘Spear Player’ came to the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] called him to embrace Islam\nbut he neither agreed nor refused. He said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, if you dispatch\nsome of your Companions to the people of Najd to call them to Islam, I expect them\nto accept.\" \"I am afraid the people of Najd will kill them.\" Said the Messenger. But he\nreplied, \"I will protect them.\" Ibn Ishaq confirms that forty men were sent to them;\nbut \tAs- Sahih \tstates that they were seventy — Al- Mundhir bin ‘Amr, one of Bani\nSa‘ida, nicknamed ‘Freed to die’ — commanded that group, who were the best and\nmost learned in the Qur’ân and jurisprudence.\nOn their way to Najd they used to gather firewood to buy food for the people of ‘Ahl\nAs- Suffah’ as charity by day and study, meditate on the meanings of the Qur’ân by\nnight. They kept on doing that till they arrived at Ma‘una Well — which was a well in\nbetween Bani ‘Amir, Harrah and Bani Saleem. They stayed there and sent the\nMessage of the Prophet [pbuh] with Haram bin Milhan, the brother of Umm Sulaim to\nthe enemy of Allâh ‘Amir bin At- Tufail. ‘Amir did not heed the Message but rather\nordered a man to spear Haram in the back. When the spear penetrated Haram’s\nbody, he saw the blood and said: \"Allâhu Akbar! \t(i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) By Lord\nof Al- Ka‘bah I have won!\"\nThen the enemy of Allâh, promptly, called out Bani ‘Amir to fight the rest. Bani ‘Amir\nrefused because they were under the protection of Abu Bara’. Therefore he turned to\nBani Saleem for help. The people of ‘Usaiyah, Ri‘al and Dhakwan, who were folks of\nBani Saleem, responded to his call. The Companions of the Prophet [pbuh], who\nwere encompassed by idolaters, kept on fighting till they were all killed. The only\n\n-- 188 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n189\nsurvivor was Ka‘b bin Zaid bin An- Najjar who was carried wounded from among the\ndead. It was in \tAl- Khandaq \t(the trench) Battle that he was killed.\n‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad- Damari and Al- Mundhir bin ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir, who were\nentrusted with the Muslims’ animals far from them, saw the birds circling in the air\nover the battleground. Al- Mundhir rushed to share in the fight till he was killed. But\n‘Amr bin Omaiyah was captured. ‘Amir set him free when he knew that he was of\nMudar tribe but that was after he had cut his hair. He did that to fulfil a pledge of his\nmother’s to set a slave free.\nReturning to the Prophet [pbuh] ‘Amr bin Omaiyah conveyed the news of the painful\ndisaster, which resulted in the murder of seventy of the best believers, and recalled\nthe tragedy of Uhud but with the difference that those of Uhud were killed in a clear\nwar but those of Ma‘una were killed in a disgraceful treachery. On his way back to\nQarqara, ‘Amr bin Omaiyah rested in the shade of a tree, and there two men of Bani\nKilab joined him. When they slept, ‘Amr killed them both, thinking that by doing that\nhe would avenge some of his killed companions. Then he found out that they had\nbeen given a pledge of protection by the Prophet [pbuh]. He told the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] what he had done. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to ‘Amr: \"You\nhave killed two people; their blood- money shall be a debt I have to discharge.\" He\nthen engaged himself collecting their blood- money from the Muslims and their allies,\nthe Jews [Ibn Hisham 2/183- 188; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/109- 110; Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/584-\n586]. This very act was later to trigger the invasion of Bani An- Nadeer.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was so deeply moved by this tragedy and that of Ar- Raji‘ that he\nused to invoke Allâh’s wrath against those people and tribes who killed his\nCompanions. Anas reported that for thirty days the Prophet [pbuh] supplicated Allâh\nagainst those who killed his Companions at Ma‘una Well. Every dawn prayer he\nwould invoke Allâh’s wrath against Ri‘l, Dhakwan, Lihyan and ‘Usaiyah. He would\nsay, \" ‘Usaiyah disobeyed Allâh and His Messenger.\" Therefore Allâh ÚÒ æÌá, sent\ndown unto His Messenger a Qur’ânic verse that we kept on reciting till it was\nabrogated later on: ‘Inform our folk that we have encountered our Lord and He is\nsatisfied with us and we are satisfied with Him.’ So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nstopped his invocation. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/586-588]\nBani An-Nadeer Invasion\nWe have already spoken about the disgraceful behaviour of the Jews and how they\nwere always thirsting to shed the blood of the Muslims and undermine the cause of\nIslam despite all the covenants and pledges they had given to the Prophet [pbuh].\nTheir behaviour fluctuated between resignation and slackness after the Banu\nQainuqa‘ event and the murder of Ka‘b bin Al- Ashraf, and rebellion coupled with\ntreacherous clandestine contacts with Quraish and the hypocrites in order to\nestablish an alliance against the Muslims after the battle of Uhud ['Aunul Ma'bood\n3/116- 117]. Being inexperienced in war tactics, they resorted to conspiracy and\nintrigue hatching. They first of all declared open hatred and enmity, and chose to\nplay all sorts of tricks that might harm the Muslims, but were very careful not to\ninitiate any sort of hostilities that might involve them in open war.\nThe Prophet [pbuh], on his part, exercised the highest degree of patience with them\nbut they went too far in their provocative deeds, especially after Ar- Raji‘ and Ma‘una\nWell events; they even made an attempt on his life.\n\n-- 189 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n190\nOnce the Prophet [pbuh] with some of his Companions set out to see Banu Nadeer\nand seek their help in raising the blood- money he had to pay to Bani Kalb for the two\nmen that ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad- Damari had killed by mistake. All of that was in\naccordance with the clauses of the treaty that both parties had already signed. On\nhearing his story they said they would share in paying the blood- money and asked\nhim and his Companions Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Ali and others to sit under a wall of their\nhouses and wait. The Jews held a short private meeting and conspired to kill the\nProphet [pbuh]. The most wicked among them, ‘Amr bin Jahsh, volunteered to climb\nup the wall and drop a large millstone on his head. One of them, Salam bin\nMashkam, cautioned them against perpetrating such a crime, predicting that Allâh\nwould divulge their plot to him, and added that such an act would constitute a\nmanifest violation of the pact concluded with the Muslims.\nIn fact, Gabriel did come down to reveal to the Prophet [pbuh] their wicked criminal\nintention, so he, with his Companions, hurried off back to Madinah. On their way, he\ntold his Companions of the Divine Revelation.\nSoon after, the Prophet [pbuh] delegated Muhammad bin Maslamah to communicate\nan ultimatum to Bani Nadeer to the effect that they should evacuate Madinah within\nten days, otherwise, their heads would be cut off. The chief of the hypocrites,\n‘Abdullah bin Ubai, urged the Jews not to pay heed to the Prophet [pbuh]’s words\nand to stay in their habitations, offering to run to their support with two thousands of\nhis followers, and assuring them of help to come from Quraizah tribe and former\nallies Banu Ghatfan. In this regards, Allâh says:\n\"If you are expelled, we (too) indeed will go out with you, and we shall\nnever obey anyone against you, and if you are attacked (in fight), we shall\nindeed help you.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 59:11]\nThe Jews regained their confidence and were determined to fight. Their chief Huyai\nbin Akhtab relied hopefully on what the chief of the hypocrites said. So he sent to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] saying: \"We will not leave our houses. Do whatever you\nlike to do.\"\nUndoubtedly the situation was awkward for the Muslims. Launching a war against\ntheir opponents at this critical stage could entail terrible far reaching ramifications in\nthe light of the unfavourable conditions they were passing through, besides the\nhostile environment growing in power and hatred around them, the harbinger of\nwhich assumed the form of killing the Muslim missions, as it has been already\nintroduced.\nThe Jews of Bani Nadeer were also a power to count for, and the prospects of\ninflicting a military defeat on them was precarious; consequently forcing them into\nwar engagement would be attended with unpredictable risks. On the other hand, the\ncontinual state of repeated assassinations and acts of treachery carried out against\nthe Muslims individually and collectively brought about unbearable headache to\nMuhammad [pbuh]’s followers. Having judged all the prevalent status quo in this\nperspective, and in the light of the disgraceful attempt on the life of the Prophet\n[pbuh], the Muslims made the decisive decisions of taking up arms whatever turn\nthe consequences could assume.\n\n-- 190 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n191\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] received the reply of Huyai bin Akhtab he said:\n\" \tAllâhu Akbar, Allâhu Akbar.\" (Allâh is the Greatest of all) and his Companions\nrepeated after him. Then he set out to fight them after appointing Ibn Umm Maktum\nto dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The standard was entrusted to\n‘Ali bin Abi Talib. He laid siege to their forts for six nights — in another version,\nfifteen.\nBanu Nadeer resorted to their castles, mounted them and started shooting arrows\nand pelting stones at the Muslims enjoying the strategic advantage that their thick\nfields of palm trees provided. The Muslims were therefore ordered to fell and burn\nthose trees. In this respect, Allâh, the All- Mighty, states in the Qur’ân:\n\"What you (O Muslims) cut down of the palm- trees (of the enemy), or you\nleft them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allâh.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 59:5]\nQuraizah tribe remained neutral, and the hypocrite ‘Abdullah bin Ubai as well as\nGhatfan failed to keep their promises of support. In this regard Allâh says:\n\"(Their allies deceived them) like Satan, when he says to man: ‘Disbelieve in\nAllâh.’ But when (man) disbelieves in Allâh, Satan says: ‘I am free of you.’\"\n[Al- Qur'an 59:16]\nThe siege did not last long for Allâh, the All- Mighty, cast horror into the hearts of the\nJews, and they willingly offered to comply with the Prophet [pbuh]’s order and leave\nMadinah. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted their request and allowed them to carry as\nmuch luggage as their camels could lift, arms were excepted. Of course, they had no\nchoice but to carry out the orders, so they took with them everything they could\ncarry even the pegs and beams of ceilings. Their caravan counted 600 loaded camels\nincluding their chiefs, Huyai bin Akhtab and Salam bin Abi Al- Huqaiq, who left for\nKhaibar whereas another party shifted to Syria. Two of them embraced Islam,\nYameen bin ‘Amr and Abu Sa‘d bin Wahab, and so they retained their personal\nwealth.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] seized their weapons, land, houses, and wealth.\nAmongst the other booty he managed to capture, there were 50 armours, 50\nhelmets, and 340 swords.\nThis booty was exclusively the Prophet [pbuh]’s because no fighting was involved in\ncapturing it. He divided the booty at his own discretion among the early Emigrants\nand two poor Helpers, Abu Dujana and Suhail bin Haneef. Anyway the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] spent a portion of this wealth on his family to sustain their living the\nyear around. The rest was expended to provide the Muslim army with equipment for\nfurther wars in the way of Allâh.\nThe invasion of Bani An- Nadeer took place in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, 4 A.H. i.e. in August\n625 A.D. Almost all the verses of \tSûrah Al- Hashr \t(Chapter 59 - The Gathering)\ndescribe the banishment of the Jews and reveal the disgraceful manners of the\nhypocrites. The verses manifest the rules relevant to the booty. In this Chapter,\nAllâh, the All- Mighty, praises the Emigrants and Helpers. This Chapter also shows the\nlegitimacy of cutting down and burning the enemy’s land and trees for military\npurposes. Such acts cannot be regarded as phenomena of corruption so long that\nthey are in the way of Allâh.\n\n-- 191 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n192\nIn this very Chapter, Allâh recommends the believers to be pious and prepare\nthemselves for the world to come and He ends it with a compliment upon Himself\nand a manifestation of His Holy Names and Attributes.\nAs this Chapter concentrates on Bani An- Nadeer and their banishment, Ibn ‘Abbas\nused to describe it as ‘An- Nadeer Chapter’. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/190-192; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/71; Sahih Al-Bukhari\n2/574-575]\nThe Invasion of Najd\nWith the peaceful victory that the Muslims achieved at Bani An- Nadeer invasion,\ntheir control over Madinah was undisputedly established, and the hypocrites receded\nto a state of silence and stopped their artful machinations publicly. Consequently the\nProphet [pbuh] had ample time to direct all his energies and human resources\ntowards suppressing the desert bedouins and curbing their harmful provocations and\nwicked malicious practices of killing his missionaries and even contemplating an\ninvasion of Madinah itself. [Fiqh As- Seerah p.214] Meanwhile, the Muslim scouting\ngroups reported building up of bedouin troops of Bani Muharib and Tha‘labah of\nGhatfan around Madinah. The Prophet [pbuh], with the Muslims, hurriedly set out to\ndiscipline those new outlaws, cast fear into their hearts and deter them from\nperpetrating further wicked practices. These deterring operations were carried out\nrepeatedly and did produce effective results. The rebellious hard- hearted desert\nbedouins were terrorized into the mountains, and Madinah remained completely\nimmune against their raids.\nIn the context of these invasions, it is interesting to draw some prominence to a\nsignificant one ¾ \tDhat Ar- Riqa‘ \t(rags) campaign ¾ which some scholars claim, took\nplace in Najd ( a large area of tableland in the Arabian Peninsula) in Rabi‘ Ath- Thani\nor Jumada Al- Ula, 4 A.H. They substantiate their claim by saying that it was\nstrategically necessary to carry out this campaign in order to quell the rebellious\nbedouins in order to meet the exigencies of the agreed upon encounter with the\npolytheists, i.e. minor Badr Battle in Sha‘ban, 4 A.H. The most authentic opinion,\nhowever, is that \tDhat Ar- Riqa‘ \tcampaign took place after the fall of Khaibar. This is\nsupported by the fact that Abu Hurairah and Abu Musa Al- Ash‘ari [R] witnessed the\nbattle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa\nAl- Ash‘ari came back from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and joined the Prophet [pbuh] at\nKhaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which the Prophet [pbuh] observed\nat \tDhat Ar- Riqa‘ \tcampaign, were revealed at ‘Asfan Invasion and this beyond a\nshadow of doubt took place after \tAl- Khandaq \t(the trench) Battle in late 5 A.H.\nThe Invasion of Badr, the Second\nWhen the Muslims destroyed the power of the Arab- desert tribes and guarded\nthemselves against their evils, they started preparations to encounter their great\nenemy. A year elapsed since they fought Quraish at Uhud. So it was due time to\nmeet them and start war again in order to determine which of the two parties was\nworthy of survival. \t[Fiqh As-Seerah p.315]\nIn Sha‘ban 4 A.H., January 626 A.D., the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] set out to Badr\naccompanied by one thousand and five hundred fighters and ten mounted horsemen,\nand with ‘Ali bin Abi Talib as standard bearer. ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah was given\n\n-- 192 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n193\nauthority over Madinah during the Prophet [pbuh]’s absence. Reaching Badr, the\nMuslims stayed there waiting for the idolaters to come.\nAbu Sufyan’s forces comprised two thousand footmen and fifty horsemen. They\nreached Mar Az- Zahran, some distance form Makkah, and camped at a wate",
  "r place\ncalled Mijannah. Being reluctant, discouraged and extremely terrified of the\nconsequences of the approaching fight, Abu Sufyan turned to his people and began\nto introduce cowardice- based flimsy pretexts in order to dissuade his men from going\nto war, saying: \"O tribe of Quraish! Nothing will improve the condition you are in but\na fruitful year — a year during which your animals feed on plants and bushes and\ngive you milk to drink. And I see that this is a rainless year, therefore I am returning\nnow and I recommend you to return with me.\"\nIt seems that his army were also possessed of the same fears and apprehensions,\nfor they readily obeyed him without the least hesitation.\nThe Muslims, who were then at Badr, stayed for eight days waiting for their enemy.\nThey took advantage of their stay by selling goods and earning double as much the\nprice out of it. When the idolaters declined to fight, the balance of powers shifted to\nrest in favour of the Muslims, who thus regained their military reputation, their\ndignity and managed to impose their awe- inspiring presence over the whole of\nArabia. In brief, they mastered and controlled the whole situation.\nThis invasion had many a name. It is called ‘Badr the Appointment’, ‘Badr, the\nSecond’, ‘Badr, the Latter’, and ‘Badr Minor’. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/209-210; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112]\nThe Invasion of Doumat Al-Jandal\nWith the Messenger [pbuh]’s return from Badr, peace and security prevailed the\nwhole area; and the Islamic headquarters, Madinah, enjoyed full security. The\nProphet [pbuh] then deemed it fit and appropriate to head for the most distant areas\nof Arabia in order to subdue all hostile elements in order to force undisputed\nrecognition out of friend and enemy alike.\nAfter a six- month lull of military activities, the Prophet [pbuh] was reported that\nsome tribes, in the vicinity of Doumat Al- Jandal, on the borders of Syria, were\ninvolved in highway robbery and plundering, and were on their way to muster troops\nand raid Madinah itself. He immediately appointed Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al- Ghifari to\ndispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence, and set out at the head of 1000\nMuslims in late Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, 5 A.H. taking with him a man, named Madhkur, from\nBani ‘Udhrah, as a guide.\nOn their way to Doumat Al- Jandal, they used to march by night and hide by day, so\nthat they might take the enemy by surprise. When they drew near their destination,\nthe Muslims discovered that the highway men had moved to another place, so they\ncaptured their cattle and shepherds. The inhabitants of Doumat Al- Jandal had also\nfled in all directions for their lives and evacuated their habitations. The Prophet\n[pbuh] stayed there for 5 days during which he despatched expeditionary forces to\nhunt for the enemy personnel but they detected none. He then returned to Madinah\nbut en route he entered into a peace treaty with ‘Uyainah bin Hisn. Doumat Al- Jandal\n\n-- 193 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n194\nis located at about a distance of fifteen days march from Madinah and five from\nDamascus.\nWith this decisive and steady progress and wise strict plans, the Prophet [pbuh]\nmanaged to spread security, control the situation and make peace prevail the whole\narea. He also succeeded in shifting the course of events for the welfare of the\nMuslims by reducing the incessant internal and external troubles. The hypocrites\nwere silenced, a tribe of the Jews evacuated while the other continued to fake good\nneighbourliness and seemingly faithful adherence to the covenants, the desert\nbedouins subdued and finally the archenemy Quraish no longer keen on attacking\nthe Muslims. This secure strategic attitude created optimum circumstances for the\nMuslims to resume their logical course in propagating Islam and communicating the\nMessages of the Lord to all worlds.\n\n-- 194 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n195\nAl-Ahzab (the Confederates) Invasion\nOnce again, peace and security enveloped the Arabian Peninsula and this turbulent\narea began to experience a period of lull after a whole year war. The Jews, however,\nwhose treachery, intrigues and disloyalty made them taste all types of humiliation\nand disgrace, were not admonished. After they had been exiled to Khaibar, they\nremained waiting anxiously for the results of the skirmishes going on between the\nMuslims and the idolaters. Contrary to their hopes, the events of the war were in\nfavour of the Muslims, therefore they started a new stage of conspiracy and prepared\nthemselves to deal a deadly blow against the Muslims, but were too cowardly to\nmanoeuvre directly against them, so they laid a dreadful plan in order to achieve\ntheir objectives. Twenty chiefs of the Jews with some celebrities of Bani Nadir went\nto Makkah to negotiate an unholy alliance with Quraish. They began to goad the\npeople there to attack the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] promising them full support\nand backing. People of Quraish, who had been languid and proved too weak to\nchallenge the Muslims at Badr, seized this opportunity to redeem their stained\nhonour and blemished reputation. The same delegation set out for Ghatfan, called\nthem to do the same, and they responded positively. The Jewish delegation then\nstarted a fresh effort and toured some parts of Arabia and managed to incite the\nconfederates of disbelief against the Prophet [pbuh], his Message and the believers\nin Allâh. Quraish, Kinanah and other allies from Tihama, in the south; rallied, ranked\nand recruited four thousand men under the leadership of Abu Sufyan. From the east\nthere came tribes of Banu Saleem, Ghatfan, Bani Murrah, etc. They all headed for\nMadinah and gathered in its vicinity at a time already agreed upon. It was a great\narmy of ten thousand fighters. They in fact outnumbered all the Muslims in Madinah,\nwomen, lads and elders included. To tell the truth, if they had launched a surprise\nattack against Madinah, they could have exterminated all the Muslims. However, the\nleadership inside the city was on the alert and the intelligence personnel managed to\nreconnoitre the area of the enemies, and reported their movement to the people in\ncharge in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned a high advisory board\nand conducted a careful discussion of a plan to defend Madinah. After a lengthy talk\nbetween military leaders and people possessed of sound advice, it was agreed, on\nthe proposal of an honourable Companion, Salman Al- Farisi, to dig trenches as\ndefensive lines. The Muslims, with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head, encouraging,\nhelping and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, most actively and\ndiligently started to build a trench around Madinah. Severe hunger, bordering on\nstarvation, could not dissuade or discourage them from achieving their desperately\nsought objective. Salman said: O Messenger of Allâh! When siege was to laid to us in\nPersia, we used to dig trenches to defend ourselves. It was really an unprecedented\nwise plan. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] hurriedly gave orders to implement the\nplan. Forty yards was allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa‘d said: We\nwere in the company of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], the men used to dig and we\nevacuate the earth on our backs.\nSome preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. Jabir bin\n‘Abdullah, seeing the Prophet [pbuh] starving, slaughtered a sheep, cooked some\nbarley and requested the Prophet [pbuh] and some Companions to accept his\ninvitation, but the Prophet [pbuh] gathered all the thousand people engaged in\ndigging the trench and they started to eat until they were all completely full and yet\nthe shoulder of mutton and dough that was being baked remained as they were\nundiminished. A certain woman brought a handful of dates and passed by the\nProphet [pbuh], who took the dates, threw them over his cloak and invited his\n\n-- 195 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n196\nfollowers to eat. The dates began to increase in number until they dropped over the\ntrim of his robe. Another illustrious preternatural example went to the effect that an\nobstinate rock stood out as an immune obstacle in the ditch. The Prophet [pbuh]\ntook the spade and struck, and the rock immediately turned into a loose sand dune.\nIn another version, Al- Bara‘ said: On \tAl- Khandaq \t(the trench) Day there stood out a\nrock too immune for our spades to break up. We therefore went to see the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] for advice. He took the spade, and struck the rock\nuttering \"in the Name of Allâh, Allâh is Great, the keys of Ash- Shâm \t(Geographical\nSyria) are mine, I swear by Allâh, I can see its palaces at the moment;\" on the\nsecond strike he said: \"Allâh is Great, Persia is mine, I swear by Allâh, I can now see\nthe white palace of Madain;\" and for the third time he struck the rock, which turned\ninto very small pieces, he said: \"Allâh is Great, I have been given the keys of Yemen,\nI swear by Allâh, I can see the gates of San‘a while I am in my place.\" The same\nversion was narrated by Ishaq. [Ibn Hisham 3/330,331] \tThe northern part of Madinah was the\nmost vulnerable, all the other sides being surrounded by mountains and palm tree\norchards, the Prophet [pbuh] as a skillful military expert, understood that the\nConfederates would march in that direction, so the trench was ordered to be on that\nside. The Muslims went on digging the trench for several days; they used to work on\nit during the day, and go back home in the evening until it had assumed its full\ndimensions militarily before the huge army of the idolaters; \t[ibid] \twhich numbered, as\nmany as ten thousand fighters, arrived and settled in the vicinity of Madinah in\nplaces called Al- Asyal and Uhud.\n\"And when the believers saw \t‘Al- Ahzab’ \t(the confederates), they said: ‘This\nis what Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) had promised us, and\nAllâh and His Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) had spoken the truth, and it\nonly added to their Faith and to their submissiveness (to Allâh).\" \t[Al- Quran\n33:22]\nThree thousand Muslims, with Muhammad [pbuh] at their head, came out to\nencounter the idolaters, with Allâh’s Promise of victory deeply established in their\nminds. They entrenched themselves in Sila‘ Mountain with the trench standing as a\nbarrier between them and the disbelievers.\nOn attempting to attack the Muslims and break into Madinah, the idolaters were\nsurprised to see a wide trench, a new stratagem unknown in Arabia before, standing\nas an obstinate obstruction. Consequently they decided to lay siege to Madinah and\nbegan to manoeuvre around the trench trying hard to find a vulnerable spot through\nwhich they could infiltrate into Madinah. To deter their enemies from approaching or\nbridging any gap in their defences, the Muslims hurled arrows, and engaged in\nskirmishes with them. The veteran fighters of Quraish were averse to this situation\nwaiting in vain in anticipation of what the siege might reveal. Therefore they decided\nthat a group of fighters led by ‘Amr bin ‘Abd- e- Wudd, ‘Ikrima bin Abi Jahl and Dirar\nbin Al- Khattab, should work its way through the trench. They, in fact, managed to do\nthat and their horsemen captured a marshy area between the trench and Sila‘\nMountain. ‘Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel, and ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed.\nAfter a short but fierce engagement, ‘Ali killed ‘Amr and obliged the others to\nevacuate in a state of panic and confusion. However, some days later, the\npolytheists conducted fresh desperate attempts but all of them failed due to Muslims’\nsteadfastness and heroic confrontation.\n\n-- 196 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n197\nIn the context of the events of the Trench Battle, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nfailed to observe some prayers in their right time. Jabir [R] narrated: On the Day of\nTrench ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab [R] came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said:\n\"O Allâh’s Messenger! I have not offered the afternoon prayer and the sun has set.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] replied: \"By Allâh! I, too, have not offered the prayer yet.\" The\nProphet [pbuh] then went to Buthan, performed ablution and observed the afternoon\nprayer after the sun had set and then offered the sunset prayer after it.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari\n2/590] \tHe was so indignant for this failure that he invoked Allâh’s wrath on his enemies\nand besought Allâh to fill their houses and graves with fire because they distracted\nhim from observing the afternoon prayer. It was narrated by Ahmed and Shafa‘i that\nthe events of that battle detained him from the noon, afternoon, evening and night\nprayers, but he observed them combined. The different narrations point to the fact\nthat the situation lasted for a few days. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.287; Sahih Muslim 1/227]\nIt is clear that, and because of the trench standing between the two parties, no\ndirect engagement took place, but rather there were military activities confined to\narrow hurling, consequently the fight claimed the lives of a small number of fighters,\nsix Muslims and ten polytheists, one or two killed by sword.\nDuring the process of fighting, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh was shot by an arrow that pierced his\nartery. Perceiving his end approaching, he invoked Allâh saying: \"Oh, Allâh, you\nknow nothing is closer to my heart than striving in Your way against those people\n(disbelievers) who belied Your Messenger and banished him from his town. Oh, Allâh,\nI deeply believe that You have decreed that we should fight them, so if there is still\nmore fighting to go with them, let me stay alive in order to strive more against\nthem. If it has settled down, I beseech you to ignite it again so that I breathe my\nlast in its context.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 3/591] \tHe concluded his supplication beseeching Allâh\nnot to let him die until he had had full revenge on Banu Quraiza. In the midst of\nthese difficult circumstances, plottery and intrigues were in fervent action against the\nMuslims. The chief criminal of Bani Nadir, Huyai, headed for the habitations of Banu\nQuraiza to incite their chief Ka‘b bin Asad Al- Qurazi, who had drawn a pact with the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] to run to his aid in times of war. Ka‘b, in the beginning\nresisted all Huyai’s temptation, but Huyai was clever enough to manipulate him,\nspeaking of Quraish and their notables in Al- Asyal, as well as Ghatfan and their\nchieftains entrenched in Uhud, all in one mind, determined to exterminate\nMuhammad [pbuh] and his followers. He, moreover, promised to stay in Ka‘b’s fort\nexposing himself to any potential danger in case Quraish and Ghatfan recanted. The\nwicked man went on in this manner until he later managed to win Ka‘b to his side\nand persuade him to break his covenant with the Muslims. \t[Ibn Hisham 3/337] \tBanu\nQuraiza then started to launch war operations against the Muslims especially the\nsecluded garrisons that housed the women and children of the Muslims. On the\nauthority of Ibn Ishaq, Safiyah [R], daughter of ‘Abdul Muttalib happened to be in a\ngarrison with Hassan bin Thabit as well as some women and children. Safiyah said:\n\"A Jew was spotted lurking around our site, which was vulnerable to any enemy\nattacks because there were no men to defend it. I informed Hassan that I was\nsuspicious of that man’s presence near us. He might take us by surprise now that the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the Muslims are too busy to come to our aid, why\ndon’t you get down and kill him? Hassan answered that he would not do it, so I took\na bar of wood, went down and struck the Jew to death. I returned and asked Hassan\nto loot him but again Hassan refused to do that. [ibid 2/228] \tThis event had a far reaching\neffect and discouraged the Jews from conducting further attacks thinking that those\nsites were fortified and protected by Muslim fighters. They, however, went on\nproviding the idolaters with supplies in token of their support against the Muslims.\n\n-- 197 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n198\nOn hearing this bad news, the Messenger [pbuh] despatched four Muslim prominent\nleaders Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubada, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha and Khawat bin\nJubair for investigation but warning against any sort of spreading panic amongst the\nMuslims and advising that they should declare in public that the rumours are\ngroundless if they happen to be so. Unfortunately the four men discovered that the\nnews was true and that the Jews announced openly that no pact of alliance existed\nany longer with Muhammad [pbuh]. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was briefed on\nthis situation, and the Muslims understood their critical position with the horrible\ndanger implied therein. Their back was vulnerable to the attacks of Banu Quraiza,\nand a huge army with no way to connive at in front, while their women and children\nunprotected standing in between. In this regard, Allâh says:\n\"And when the eyes grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats, and\nyou were harbouring doubts about Allâh. There, the believers were tried and\nshaken with a mighty shaking.\"\n[Al- Qur'an 33:10, 11]\nNow that the Muslims were shut in within the Trench on the defensive, the hypocrites\ntaunted them with having indulged in delusive hopes of defeating Kisra, emperor of\nPersia, and Caesar, emperor of the Romans. They began to sow the seeds of\ndefeatism, and pretended to withdraw for the defence of their homes, though these\nwere in no way exposed to danger. Here, Allâh says:\n\"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of\ndoubts) said, ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but\ndelusions!’ And when a party of them said: ‘O people of Yathrib (Al-\nMadinah), there is no stand (possible) for you (against the enemy attack!)\ntherefore go back!’ And a band of them asked for permission of the Prophet\n([pbuh]) saying: ‘Truly, our homes lie open (to the enemy).’ And they lay\nnot open. They but wished to flee.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:12, 13]\nThe Messenger of Allâh, [pbuh] wrapped himself in his robe and began to meditate\non the perfidy of Banu Quraiza. The spirit of hopefulness prevailed over him and he\nrose to his feet saying:\n\"Allâh is Great. Hearken you Muslims, to Allâh’s good tidings of victory and\nsupport.\"\nHe then started to lay decisive plans aiming at protecting the women and children,\nand sent some fighters back to Madinah to guard them against any surprise assault\nby the enemy. The second step was to take action that could lead to undermining\nthe ranks of the disbelieving confederates. There, he had in mind to conclude a sort\nof reconciliation with the chiefs of Ghatfan on the basis of donating them a third of\nMadinah’s fruit crops. He sought the advice of his chief Companions, namely, Sa‘d\nbin Mu‘adh and Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah, whose reply went as follows:\n\"O Messenger of Allâh! If it is Allâh’s injunction, then we have to obey, but if it is a\nnew course you want to follow just to provide security for us then we don’t need it.\nWe experienced those people in polytheism and idolatry and we can safely say that\nthey don’t need the fruit of our orchards, they rather need to exterminate us\ncompletely. Now that Allâh has honoured us with Islam, I believe the best recourse\nin this situation is to put them to the sword.\" Thereupon the Prophet [pbuh]\n\n-- 198 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n199\ncorrected their Belief saying: \"My new policy is being forged to provide your security\nafter all the Arabs have united to annihilate you (Muslims).\"\nAllâh, the Glorious, the Exalted, praise is to him, created something that led to the\ndissension of the enemies of Islam and later on to their full defeat. A man from the\ntribe of Ghatfan called Na‘im bin Mas‘ud asked to be admitted in the audience of the\nProphet [pbuh]. He declared that he had embraced Islam secretly and asked the\nProphet [pbuh] to order him do anything that might benefit the Muslims. The Prophet\n[pbuh] asked him to do anything that could help the Muslims in the present distress\nand use any strategem of avail. The man, in a shuttle movement, between the Jews,\nQuraish and Ghatfan managed to incite each party to let down the other. He went to\nsee the chiefs of Banu Quraiza and whispered in their ears not to trust Quraish nor\nfight with them unless the latter pledged some hostages. He tried to lend support to\nhis counsel by claiming that Quraish would forsake them if they perceived that\nvictory over Muhammad [pbuh] was far fetched, and the Muslims then would have\nterrible revenge on them. Na‘im, then headed for the camp of Quraish and managed\nto practise a similar strategem in its final result but different in content. He claimed\nthat he felt that the Jews regretted breaching their covenant with Muhammad [pbuh]\nand his followers. He told them that the Jews maintained regular correspondence\nwith the Muslims to the effect that Quraishite hostages be sent to the camp of the\nMuslims with full Jewish allegiance paid to them as already agreed upon. Na‘im then\nexhorted Quraish not to send hostages to the Jews. On a third errand, he did the\nsame with the people of Ghatfan.\nOn Saturday night, Shawwal 5 A.H., both Quraish and Ghatfan despatched envoys to\nthe Jews exhorting them to go into war against Muhammad [pbuh]. The Jews sent\nback messages that they would not fight on Saturday. They added that they needed\nhostages from them to guarantee their consistency. On receiving the replies, Quraish\nand Ghatfan came to believe Na‘im’s words fully. Therefore, they sent a message to\nthe Jews again inviting them to war and asking them to preclude that condition of\nhostages. Na‘im’s scheme proved successful, and a state of distrust and suspicion\namong the disbelieving allies prevailed and reduced their morale to deplorable\ndegree.\nMeanwhile, the Muslims were preoccupied supplicating their Lord to protect their\nhomes and provide security for their families. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his\npart invoked Allâh’s wrath on the Confederates supplicating:\n\"Oh, Allâh! You are quick in account, You are the sender of the Book, we\nbeseech You to defeat the confederates.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/411,2/590]\nAllâh the Glorious, the Exalted, responded to the call of the Muslims on the spot.\nCoupled with the dissension and variance that found their way into the hearts of the\ndisbelievers, forces of nature — wind, rain and cold wearied them, tents were blown\ndown, cooking vessels and other equipage overthrown.\nThat very cold night the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched Hudhaifa bin Al-\nYaman to hunt around for news about the enemy. He found out that they were\npreparing to leave frustrated for their inability to achieve their target. Allâh did really\nfulfill His Promise, spared the Muslims fighting a formidable army, supported His\nslave (Muhammad [pbuh]) and inflicted a heavy blow on the Confederates.\n\n-- 199 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n200\nThe battle of the Trench took place in the fifth year Hijri. The siege of Madinah\nstarted in Shawwal and ended in Dhul Qa‘dah, i.e. it lasted for over a month. It was\nin fact a battle of nerves rather than of losses. No bitter fighting was recorded;\nnevertheless, it was one of the most decisive battles in the early history of Islam and\nproved beyond a shadow of doubt that no forces, however huge, could ever\nexterminate the nascent Islamic power growing steadily in Madinah. When Allâh\nobliged the Confederates to evacuate, His Messenger was in a position to confidently\ndeclare that thenceforth he would take the initiative in war and would not wait for\nthe land of Islam to be invaded. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/590]\n\n-- 200 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n201\nInvading Banu Quraiza\nArchangel Gabriel [AWS], on the very day the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] came back\nto Madinah after the previous battle, and while he was washing in Umm Salama’s\nhouse, visited him asking that he should unsheathe his sword and head for the\nhabitation of the seditious Banu Quraiza and fight them. Gabriel noted that he with a\nprocession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their\nhearts.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], immediately summoned the prayer caller and\nordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm\nMaktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib\nwho marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews\nabusing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who on his part set out at the head of three\nthousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of \tAnsar \t(Helpers) and \tMuhajireen\n(Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due.\nSome Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others\noffered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet [pbuh] objected to neither. When\nthey reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts.\nSeeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka‘b bin Asad offered\nthem three alternatives: to embrace Islam, and consequently their life, wealth,\nwomen and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such\nbehaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about\nthe veracity of Muhammad’s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then\nchallenge the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers to the sword to either exterminate\nthe Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad [pbuh]\nand his people by surprise on Saturday — a day mutually understood to witness no\nfighting.\nNone of those alternatives appealed them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly,\nturned to them saying: \"You have never been decisive in decision- making since you\nwere born\" The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some\nMuslims, who had maintained good relation with them, in order to learn about their\nfate in the light of the current circumstances. They requested that Abu Lubaba be\ndespatched to them for advice. On his arrival, the men began to implore, women and\nchildren to cry desperately. In answer to their demand for advice he pointed to his\nthroat saying it was homicide awaiting them. He then immediately realized that he\nhad betrayed the Prophet’s trust, so he headed directly for the mosque in Madinah\nand tied himself to a wooden tall pole swearing that no one would untie him save the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], and added that he would never enter the habitation of\nBanu Quraiza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made. When the Messenger\n[pbuh] was informed of this incident, he said, \" I would have begged Allâh to forgive\nhim if he had asked me, but since he had tied himself out of his own free will, then it\nwas Allâh Who would turn to him in forgiveness.\"\nThe Jews of Banu Quraiza could have endured the siege much longer because food\nand water were plentifully available and their strongholds were greatly fortified,\nwhereas the Muslims were in the wild bare land suffering a lot from cold and hunger,\nlet alone too much fatigue consequent on endless warfare operations that had\nstarted even before the battle of Confederates. Nevertheless, this was a battle of\nnerves, for Allâh had cast fear in the the Jews’ hearts, and their morale had almost\ncollapsed especially when two Muslim heroes, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and Az- Zubair bin\n\n-- 201 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n202\n‘Awwam [R]ã proceeded with ‘Ali swearing that he would never stop until he had\neither stormed their garrisons or been martyred like Hamza (a former Muslim\nmartyr).\nIn the light of this reluctance, they had nothing except to comply with the\nMessenger’s judgement. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered that the men should\nhandcuffed, and this was done under the supervision of Muhammad bin Salamah Al-\nAnsari while the women and children were isolated in confinement. Thereupon Al-\nAws tribe interceded begging the Prophet [pbuh] to be lenient towards them. He\nsuggested that Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, a former ally, be deputed to give verdict about\nthem, and they agreed.\nSa‘d meanwhile stayed behind in Madinah due to a serious wound he sustained in\nthe Confederates Battle. He was summoned and brought on a donkey. On his way to\nt he Prophet [pbuh], the Jews used to exhort him to be lenient in his judgement on\naccount of former friendship. Sa‘d remained silent but when they persisted he\nuttered: \"It is time for Sa‘d not to be afraid of the blame of the blamers.\" On hearing\nthis decisive attitude, some of them returned to Madinah waiting for a desperate\ndoom.\nOn arrival, he alighted with the help of some men. He was informed that the Jews\nhad agreed to accept his verdict about them. He immediately wondered if his\njudgement would pass on all the people present, the Prophet [pbuh] included,\nturning his face away in honour of him. The reply was positive.\nHe decided that all the able- bodied male persons belonging to the tribe should be\nkilled, women and children taken prisoners and their wealth divided among the\nMuslim fighters. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted his judgement saying that Sa‘d had\nadjudged by the Command of Allâh. In fact, the Jews deserved that severe punitive\naction for the ugly treachery they had harboured against Islam, and the large\narsenal they have amassed and which consisted of one thousand and five hundred\nswords, two thousand spears, three hundred armours and five hundred shields, all of\nwhich went into the hands of the Muslims. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of\nMadinah and a number of Jews between six and seven hundred were beheaded\ntherein. Hot beds of intrigue and treachery were thus exterminated once and for all.\nHuyai, a chief criminal of war, a devil of Bani Nadir and Safiyah’s father, had joined\nthe ranks of Banu Quraiza when Quraish and Ghatfan defected, was admitted into\nthe audience of the Prophet [pbuh] with his hands tied to his neck with a rope. In\naudacious defiance, he declared obstinate enmity to the Prophet [pbuh] but admitted\nthat Allâh’s Will was to be fulfilled and added that he was resigned to his fate. He\nwas ordered to sit down, and was beheaded on the spot.\nOnly one woman of the Jews was killed because she had killed a Muslim warrior by\nflinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Is",
  "lam\nand their lives, wealth and children were spared. As for the spoils of the war, the\nProphet [pbuh] divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allâh’s\ninjunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter.\nWomen captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry. For\nhimself, the Prophet [pbuh] selected Rehana bint ‘Amr bin Khanaqah, manumitted\nand married her in the year 6 Hijri. She died shortly after the farewell pilgrimage and\nwas buried in Al- Baqi‘ [Ibn Hisham 2/245; Talqeeh Fuhum Ahl Al-Athar p.12] .\n\n-- 202 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n203\nAfter the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa‘d\nbin Mu‘adh’s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his\nsupplication ‘Aishah [R] narrated, Sa‘d’s wounds began to bleed from the front part\nof his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet [pbuh] had pitched for him in\nthe mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and\nwatch his well- being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood\nflowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa‘d’s tent, there was the tent of\nBanu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from\nyou? Lo! it was Sa‘d’s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/591]\nJabir narrated that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had said: \"The Throne of the\nCompassionate shook for the death of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/536; Sahih Muslim 2/294;\nJami' At-Tirmidhi 2/225]\" When his bier was carried, At- Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged\nit was too light. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] retorted:\n\"The angels are carrying him.\"\nIn the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin\nSuwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him,\nand another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of ‘Ukasha, died.\nAbu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and\nthen he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allâh the All- Forgiving\nrevealed a verse to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to the effect that Allâh had turned\nto Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him but he insisted\nthat the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself do it. And this was done shortly before\nthe morning prayer.\nThis \tGhazwah \ttook place in the month of Dhul Qa‘dah in the year five Hijri [Ibn Hisham\n2/237,238; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/590,591; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/72-74; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.287-290] , and the siege of\nBanu Quraiza’s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates was revealed\ncontaining Allâh’s Words concerning the basic issues relating to the believers and\nhypocrites during the battle of the Confederates, and the consequences of the\ntreachery and breaching of covenants by the Jews.\n\n-- 203 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n204\nMilitary Activities continued\nSalam bin Abi Al- Huqaiq (Abu Rafi‘) was a terrible Jew criminal, who had mustered\nthe troops of the Confederates and provided them with a lot of wealth and supplies,\non the one hand [Fath Al- Bari 7/343], and used to malign the Prophet [pbuh], on the\nother. When the Muslims had settled their affair with Banu Quraiza; Al- Khazraj tribe,\na rival of Al- Aws, asked for the Prophet’s permission to kill that criminal in order to\nmerit a virtue equal to that of Al- Aws who had killed another criminal of the Jews,\nKa‘b bin Al- Ashraf. The Prophet [pbuh] gave them his permission provided that no\nwomen or children be killed.\nA group of five people with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ateeq at their head, headed for Khaibar\nwhere ‘Abu Rafi‘’s fort was situated. When they approached the place, ‘Abdullah\nadvised his men to stay a little behind, while he went ahead disguised himself in his\ncloak as if he had been relieving himself. When the people of the fort went in, the\ngate- keeper called him to enter thinking he was one of them. ‘Abdullah went in and\nlurked inside. He then began to unbolt the doors leading to Salam’s room. There it\nwas absolutely dark but he managed to put him to the sword, and then leave in\nsafety. On his way back, his leg broke so he wrapped it up in a band, and hid in a\nsecret place until morning when someone stood on the wall and announced the\ndeath of Salam bin Abi Al- Huqaiq officially. On hearing the glad news he left and\nwent to see the Prophet [pbuh], who listened to the whole story, and then asked\n‘Abdullah to stretch his leg, which he wiped and the fracture healed on the spot.[Sahih\nAl-Bukhari 2/577]\nIn another version, all the group of five participated in killing that enemy of Islam.\nThis incident took place in Dhul Qa‘dah or Dhul Hijjah in the year five Hijri. \t[Rahmat-al-\nlil'alameen 2/223]\nShortly after the conclusion of the battle with the Confederates and Quraiza, the\nProphet [pbuh] began to despatch punitive expeditions to force the aggressive tribes\nand rebellious Arabians to come to peaceful terms with the rising state of Islam.\nA platoon of thirty believers under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was\ndespatched on a military mission in Muharram, the sixth year Hijri, following the two\nprevious battles. It headed for the habitation of Bani Bakr sept. The Muslims\nattacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils fell to the lot\nof the Muslims who returned home with a terrible disbeliever, Thumamah bin Uthal\nAl- Hanafi, chief of Bani Hanifa, who had gone out by order of Musailama, the Liar \t[As-\nSeerah Al-Halabiyah 2/297] , to assassinate the Prophet [pbuh]. The Prophet’s Companions\ntied him to a pole of the Prophetic Mosque. To a question posed by the Prophet\n[pbuh], Thumamah used to say: \"If you were to kill someone, then you would have\nto choose one of noble descent, if you were to be gracious, then let it be to a grateful\nman and if you were to ask for money, you would have to ask for it from a generous\nman.\" He repeated that three times on three different occasions. On the third time,\nthe Prophet [pbuh] ordered that he should be released. He soon went nearby,\nwashed and then came back to profess the new faith addressing the Prophet [pbuh]:\n\"No face had been more awful to me than yours but now it is the closest to my\nheart, no religion had ever been more repugnant to me than yours, now it is the\ndearest in my heart. Now I want to perform the \t‘Umrah \t(lesser pilgrimage).\" The\nProphet [pbuh] gave him good tidings and asked him to do that. On his arrival in\nMakkah, the Quraishites accused him of apostasy. He denied it and affirmed that he\n\n-- 204 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n205\nhad embraced Islam, and then swore that they would never get a grain from\nYamama, a suburban area around Makkah, unless the Prophet [pbuh] would allow it.\nIn fact, he did it and refused to send food supplies to Makkah until the Prophet\n[pbuh] interceded at the Makkans’ earnest plea. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/119; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool,\np.292-293]\nBani Lihyan Invasion\nBani Lihyan had acted treacherously towards ten of the Prophet’s Companions and\nhad them hanged. Their habitation being situated deep in the heart of Hijaz on the\nborders of Makkah, and due to deep- seated blood- revenge between the Muslims on\nthe one hand, and Quraish and the Arabians on the other, the Prophet [pbuh]\ndeemed it unwise to penetrate deep and come close to the greatest enemy, Quraish.\nHowever, when the power of the allied Confederates collapsed and they began to\nslacken and resign to the current unfavourable balance of power, the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] seized this rare opportunity and decided that it was time to take\nrevenge on Bani Lihyan. He set out in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal or Jumada Al- Ula in the year\nsix Hijri at the head of two hundred Muslim fighters and made a feint of heading for\nSyria, then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, the scene of his Companions’\ntragedy, and invoked Allâh’s mercy on them. News of his march reached Bani Lihyan,\nwho immediately fled to the mountain tops nearby and thus remained out of his\nreach. On his way back, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched a group of ten horsemen to\na place called Kura‘ Al- Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish in order to\nindirectly confirm his growing military power. All these skirmishes took fourteen\ndays, after which he left back for home.\nExpeditions and Delegations continued\n1. \tA platoon led by ‘Ukasha bin Al- Mihsan was despatched to a place called Al-\nGhamir inhabited by Bani Asad in the year six Hijri. The enemy immediately\nfled leaving behind them two hundred camels which were taken to Madinah.\n2. \tA platoon led by Muhammad bin Maslamah set out towards the habitation of\nBani Tha‘labah in Dhil Qassa. But a hundred men of the enemies ambushed\nand killed all of them except Muhammad bin Maslamah who managed to\nescape but badly wounded.\n3. \tIn retaliation against Bani Tha‘labah, Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah, at the head\nof forty men, was despatched to Dhil Qassa. They walked that night and took\nthe enemy by surprise in the morning. Again, they fled to the mountains\nexcept one who was injured, and later embraced Islam. A lot of booty fell to\ntheir lot in that particular incident.\n4. \tA platoon, under the leadership of Zaid bin Haritha, was sent to Al- Jumum,\nthe habitation of Bani Saleem, in the same year. A woman from Bani Muzaina\nshowed them the way to the enemy’s camp. There the Muslims took some\ncaptives and gained a lot of booty. Later on, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\ngranted the woman her freedom and married her to one of his followers.\n5. \tZaid bin Haritha, in Jumada Al- Ula 6 Hijri, at the head of a hundred and\nseventy horsemen, set out to a place called Al- ‘Ais, intercepted a caravan of\nQuraish led by Abul- ‘As, the Prophet’s relative and looted their camels. Abul-\n‘As escaped and took refuge in Zainab’s (his wife and the Prophet’s daughter)\nhouse. He begged her to ask the Prophet [pbuh] for the restitution of his\nwealth. The Prophet [pbuh] recommended, but without coercion, that the\n\n-- 205 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n206\npeople do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth. He went\nback to Makkah, gave over the trusts to those entitled to them, embraced\nIslam and emigrated to Madinah where the Prophet [pbuh] reunited him with\nhis wife, Zainab, after three and a half years of their first marriage contract.\nThe verse relating to prohibition of marriage between women Muslims and\ndisbelievers had not been revealed then.\n6. \tIn Jumada Ath- Thania, the same year, Zaid at the head of fifteen men raided\nBani Tha‘labah and captured twenty of their camels but the people had fled.\n7. \tIn Rajab of the same year, Zaid, at the head of twelve men, set out to a place\ncalled Wadi Al- Qura in a reconnaissance mission to explore the movements of\nthe enemy. The people there attacked the Muslims, killed nine of them, while\nthe rest including Zaid bin Haritha managed to escape. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 2/226; Za'd\nAl-Ma'ad 2/120-122]\n8. \tThe invasion of \tAl- Khabt \t(diluted yoghurt) took place in the year eight Hijri\ni.e. before Al- Hudaibiyah Treaty. Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah led three\nhundred horsemen to observe a caravan belonging to Quraish. Because of the\ninadequacy of food supplies, they began to starve so much that they had\nKhabt \t(diluted yoghurt), hence the appellation \"The Army of Al- Khabt\". \tOne of\nthe men slaughtered nine camels at three times, three each time at different\nstages of the mission. Abu ‘Ubaidah, the leader of the campaign prohibited\nhim from doing so. The sea was generous and presented them with an animal\ncalled \tAl- ‘Anbar \t(sperm- whale) so rich in fat that they subsisted on it for half\na month. When they came back home, they narrated the story to the Prophet\n[pbuh], who commented that it was provision granted by Allâh, and asked\nthem to share him some of its meat. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/625,626; Sahih Muslim 2/145,146]\nThis campaign came chronologically prior to Al- Hudaibiyah Treaty because of and\nafter which the Muslims stopped intercepting Quraishi caravans.\n\n-- 206 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n207\nBani Al-Mustaliq (Muraisi‘) Ghazwah, Sha‘ban 6 Hijri\nThough militarily it did not assume its full dimension, this \tGhazwah \thad certain\nimplications that brought about a state of turbulence within the Islamic State, and\nresulted in disgracefulness to clothe in the hypocrites. Moreover, it entailed\nenactment of consolidating legislations that attached an impression of nobility,\ndignity and purity of souls to the Islamic community.\nNews reached the Prophet [pbuh] on Sha‘ban 2nd. to the effect that the chief of Bani\nAl- Mustaliq, Al- Harith bin Dirar had mobilised his men, along with some Arabs, to\nattack Madinah. Buraidah bin Al- Haseeb Al- Aslami was immediately despatched to\nverify the reports. He had some words with Abi Dirar, who confirmed his intention of\nwar. He later sent a reconnoiterer to explore the positions of the Muslims but he was\ncaptured and killed. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned his men and ordered them to\nprepare for war. Before leaving, Zaid bin Haritha was mandated to see to the affairs\nof Madinah and dispose them. On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the disbelievers\ngot frightened and the Arabs going with them defected and ran away to their lives.\nAbu Bakr was entrusted with the banner of the Emigrants, and that of the Helpers\nwent to Sa‘d bin ‘Ubada. The two armies were stationed at a well called Muraisi.\nArrow shooting went on for an hour, and then the Muslims rushed and engaged with\nthe enemy in a battle that ended in full victory for the Muslims. Some men were\nkilled, women and children of the disbelievers taken as captives, and a lot of booty\nfell to the lot of the Muslims. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper.\nAmongst the captives was Juwairiyah, daughter of Al- Harith, chief of the\ndisbelievers. The Prophet [pbuh] married her and, in compensation, the Muslims had\nto manumit a hundred others of the enemy prisoners who embraced Islam, and were\nthen called the Prophet’s in- laws. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112,113; Ibn Hisham 2/289,290,294,295]\nThe Treacherous Role of the Hypocrites prior to the Bani Al-Mustaliq Ghazwah\n‘Abdullah bin Ubai, a terrible hypocrite was full of rancour against Islam and the\nMuslims because he believed that the Prophet [pbuh] had dispossessed him of his\nleadership over Al- Aws and Al- Khazraj, two clans already agreed on the Prophethood\nof Muhammad [pbuh] and his masterhood over them.\n‘Abdullah’s rancour had appeared before he feigned Islam. Following the battle of\nBadr, he made pretensions of being a Muslim, but deep at heart, he remained that\nterrible enemy of Allâh, His Messenger; and all the believers, in general. His sole\ntarget had always been to sow the seeds of dissension in the Muslim community, and\nundermine the cause of the new heavenly religion it has. His treacherous behaviour\ncould be witnessed everywhere but was strikingly evident in his wicked attempts at\ncreating a state of confusion and disorder amongst the Muslims at Uhud Battle. His\nhypocrisy and deceit assumed serious and ugly dimensions when he used to stand\nup among the Muslims shortly before the Prophet’s Friday speech, and mockingly say\nto them: \"This is the Messenger of Allâh, who has honoured you with Allâh, so you\nhave got to support, obey and listen to him,\" and then he would sit down.\nHe did the same following Uhud Battle on Friday. He was so rude and presumptuous\nthat his words smacked unmistakingly of deeply- rooted rancour, so that some of the\nMuslims took him by his cloak reproachingly and silenced him. He immediately left,\nuttering rude and mocking words. A Helper met him at the Mosque gate and ordered\nhim to return and beg the Messenger for Allâh’s forgiveness, but he retorted that he\n\n-- 207 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n208\nhad never wanted him to ask for that. [Ibn Hisham 2/105] \tHe, moreover, conducted\nclandestine contacts with Bani Nadir, another tribe of Jews, encouraging them to\nmake alliance with him and promising support for them; all of this in his ceaseless\nefforts in a long process of conspiracy and intrigue hatched against the Muslims.\nAllâh’s Words as regards his treacherous acts and awe- inspiring attempts during the\nTrench Battle came to testify quite clearly to this mode of hypocrisy:\n\"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of\ndoubts) said: ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but\ndelusions!\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:12]\nThe verses go on in the same context to describe the hypocrite as a coward and a\ndefeatist. He is a liar and has no regard for pledges solemnly made. He is\ntreacherous, disloyal and perfidious. He is niggardly and greedy. In short, he is the\ncomplete antithesis of a true believer:\n\"They think that \tAl- Ahzab \t(the Confederates) have not yet withdrawn, and\nif \tAl- Ahzab \t(the Confederates) should come (again), they would wish they\nwere in the deserts (wandering) among the bedouins, seeking news about\nyou (from a far place); and if they (happen) to be among you, they would\nnot fight but little.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:20]\nAll enemies of Islam from the Jews, hypocrites and polytheists did acknowledge that\nIslam had the upper hand not because of material superiority, multitudes of troops\nor much equipment; but it was rather due to the noble values, refined ethics and\nhigh attributes that imbued the Muslim community and whoever was attached to it.\nThe enemies of Islam were already aware of that flood of light derived wholly from\nthe person of the Prophet [pbuh] , who always stood as an excellent exemplar for\nmen to copy and follow.\nThe enemies of Islam, after steering the course of futile warfare against the new\nreligion for five years, came to realize fully that exterminating Islam is not accessible\nin the battlefields, so they resorted to other tactics. They, being reputed gossip-\nmongers, decided to launch a widespread propaganda campaign aiming at slandering\nthe person of the Prophet [pbuh] in a most sensitive area of the Arabian life, namely\nethics and traditions. Following the battle of the Confederates, the Prophet [pbuh]\nmarried Zainab bint Jahsh after her marriage with Zaid bin Haritha, his adopted son,\nhad broken up. They seized this opportunity and began to circulate idle talk against\nthe Prophet [pbuh] in Arabia depending on a tradition among the desert Arabs that\nprohibits contracting a marriage with an adopted son’s divorcee. They alleged that\nhis marriage would be considered a heinous sin. They also based their malicious\npropaganda on the fact that Zainab was his fifth wife whereas the number was\nstrictly limited to a maximum of four in the Noble Qur’ân, hence the validity of this\nmarriage was in doubt, according to them.\nThese rumours and gossips had a negative impact on the morale of some weak-\nhearted Muslims until the decisive verses were revealed acquitting the Prophet\n[pbuh] and invalidating all those ill designs and obnoxious schemes:\n\"O Prophet (Muhammad [pbuh])! Keep your duty to Allâh, and obey not the\ndisbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e. do not follow their advices). Verily!\nAllâh is Ever All- Knower, All- Wise.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:1]\n\n-- 208 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n209\nThe wicked Role they played in the course of the Ghazwah of Bani Al-Mustaliq\nDuring this \tGhazwah, the hypocrites almost managed to create a sort of discord\namong the Muslims themselves, coupled with a serious and ugly slander against the\nProphet [pbuh] himself. In short, their behaviour was an authentic translation of\nAllâh’s Words:\n\"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing\nexcept disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst\n(spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you …\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:47]\nA quarrel was about to break out between the Emigrants and the Helpers on account\nof plots and evil intentions designed by the hypocrites. The Prophet [pbuh] told them\noff describing their misbehaviour as something smacking of pre- Islamic practices.\nThey, hypocrites with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai at their head, were furious for the challenge\nwhich the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven\nbehind closed doors, and swore \"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of\nMadinah,\" and added: \"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our\nland. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\" When that talk was reported to the\nProphet [pbuh], ‘Umar, a venerable Companion, asked for permission to have Ibn\n‘Ubai killed. The Prophet [pbuh] naturally turned down his proposal on the grounds\nthat it did not become of a Prophet [pbuh] to be accused of killing his people. He, on\nthe contrary in an unexpected move, asked ‘Umar to announce departure. He\nmarched with his men for two days until the sun grew too hot. They stopped and fell\nasleep, a clever attempt at diverting his people’s attention from the previous event.\n‘Abdullah’s son heard of that vile of his father and as the party reached Madinah, he\ndrew his sword and barred his father’s entry into the town until he had confessed\nand declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and the\nProphet [pbuh] the most honourable of them. Thus the boast recoiled on his head. It\nwas also reported that the son was ready to kill his father if the Prophet [pbuh] had\nwanted him to.\nThe Slander Affair\nThis extremely painful incident took place on the Prophet’s return from the\nexpedition against Bani Mustaliq. The Muslim army had to halt for a night at a place,\na short distance from Madinah. In this expedition, the Prophet [pbuh] was\naccompanied by his noble and talented wife, ‘Aishah [R]. As it so happened, ‘Aishah\n[R] went out some distance from the camp to attend to the call of nature. When she\nreturned, she discovered that she had dropped her necklace somewhere. The\nnecklace itself was of no great value, but as it was a loan from a friend, ‘Aishah [R]\nwent out again to search for it. On her return, to her great grief and mortification,\nthe army had already marched away with the camel she was riding, her attendants\nthinking that she was in the litter as she was then thin, very young and light of\nweight. In her helplessness she sat down and cried till sleep overpowered her.\nSafwan bin Mu‘attal, an Emigrant, who was coming in the rear recognized her as he\nhad seen her before the verse enjoining the veil was revealed, and brought her on\nhis camel to Madinah without saying a single word to her, himself walking behind the\nanimal. The hypocrites of Madinah led by ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai bin Salul, sought to\nmake capital out of this incident and spread a malicious scandal against ‘Aishah [R]\nand unfortunately some of the Muslims also became involved in it. On arrival in\nMadinah, the Prophet [pbuh] held counsel with his Companions, who pronounced\n\n-- 209 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n210\ndifferent opinions ranging from divorce to retention. The incident almost roused a\nfight between two rival factions, Al- Aws and Al- Khazraj, but the Prophet’s\nintervention silenced both parties on the sport. ‘Aishah [R], unaware of the rumours\nbeing circulated, fell ill and was confined to bed for a month. On recovering, she\nheard of the slander and took permission to go and see her parents seeking\nauthentic news. She then burst into tears and stayed for two days and one sleepless\nnight ceaselessly weeping to such an extent that she felt her liver was about to rip\nopen. The Prophet [pbuh] visited her in that situation, and after testifying to the\nOneness of Allâh he told her, \"If you are innocent, Allâh will acquit you, otherwise,\nyou have to beg for His forgiveness and pardon.\" She stopped weeping and asked\nher parents to speak for her, but they had nothing to say, so she herself took the\ninitiative and said \"Should I tell you I am innocent, and Allâh knows that I am surely\ninnocent, you will not believe me; and if I were to admit something of which, Allâh\nknows, I am innocent, you will believe me, then I will have nothing to make recourse\nto except the words of the father of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph):\n\"So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allâh (Alone) Whose Help can\nbe sought against that which you assert.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 12:18]\nShe then turned away and lay down for some rest. At that decisive moment the\nRevelation came acquitting ‘Aishah [R] of all the slanderous talk fabricated in this\nconcern. ‘Aishah [R], of course, was wholeheartedly joyful and praised Allâh\nthankfully. Allâh’s Words in this regard went as follows:\n\"Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah [R] — the\nwife of the Prophet [pbuh]) are a group among you.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 24:11]\nThe principal elements involved in the slander affair, Mistah bin Athatha, Hassan bin\nThabit and Hamnah bint Jahsh, were flogged with eighty stripes.\nAs for the man who took the principal part, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, he was not flogged,\neither because the corporal punishment commutes the chastisement in store for him\nin the Hereafter, and he does not deserve this merit, or for the same public interest\nfor which he was not killed previously. He, moreover, became the butt of reproach\nand humiliation amongst his people after his real intentions had been unequivocally\nexposed to all the public. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/364,2/696-698; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/113-115; Ibn Hisham 2/297-307]\nAlmost a month later, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab were\nengaged in the following talk: \"Don’t you see ‘Umar if I had had him (Abdullah bin\nUbai) killed, a large number of dignitaries would have furiously hastened to fight for\nhim. Now, on the contrary, if I ask them to kill him, they will do so out of their own\nfree will.\" ‘Umar replied \"I swear by Allâh that the Prophet’s judgement is much more\nsound than mine.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/293]\n\n-- 210 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n211\nDelegations and Expeditions following Al-Muraisi‘ Ghazwah\n1. \tA military expedition led by ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Auf was despatched to the\nhabitation of Bani Kalb in Doumat Al- Jandal in Sha‘ban 6 Hijri. Before setting\nout, the Prophet [pbuh] summoned ‘Abdur Rahman, and placed his hand on\nthe latter’s hand invoking Allâh’s blessings and giving him commandments to\nact magnanimously during the war. He told him to marry the king’s daughter\nif they obeyed him. ‘Abdur Rahman stayed among those people for three\ndays, invited them to Islam and they responded positively. He then did marry\nthe king’s daughter Tamadur bint Al- Asbagh.\n2. \tIn the same month and year, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was despatched at the head of\na platoon to the habitation of Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr in a place called Fadk.\nProphet Muhammad [pbuh] had been reported that those had rallied ranks to\nsupport the Jews. The Muslim fighters used to march in the day and lurk at\nnight. On their way, they captured an enemy scout who admitted being sent\nto Khaibar tribe, to offer them support in return for their dates. ‘Ali and his\ncompanions raided their encampment, captured five hundred camels and two\nthousand goats, but Banu Sa‘d, with their chieftain Wabr bin ‘Aleem had fled\naway.\n3. \tAn expedition led by Abu Bakr As- Siddiq or Zaid bin Haritha was despatched\nto Wadi Al- Qura in Ramadan 6 Hijri after Fazara sept had made an attempt at\nthe Prophet’s life. Following the morning prayer, the detachment was given\norders to raid the enemy. Some of them were killed and others captured.\nAmongst the captives, were Umm Qirfa and her beautiful daughter, who was\nsent to Makkah as a ransom for the release of some Muslim prisoners there.[]\nUmm Qirfa’s attempts at the Prophet’s life recoiled on her, and the thirty\nhorsemen she had gathered and sustained to implement her evil scheme\nwere all killed.\n4. \tAnas bin Malik reported that some people belonging to tribe of ‘Uraina came\nto Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] and made pretensions to Islam. They stayed in\nMadinah but found its climate uncongenial, so they were asked to pitch their\ntents in the pastures nearby. They did so and were all right. They then fell on\nthe Prophet’s shepherd and killed him, turned apostates from Islam and drove\noff the camels. This news reached the Prophet [pbuh] , who sent a group of\ntwenty Muslims led by Karz bin Jabir Al- Fihri on their track. They were\nbrought and handed over to him. He had their hands and feet cut off, their\neyes gouged out in recompense for their behaviour, and then they were\nthrown on the stony ground until they died. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/122]\nBiographers also reported ‘Amr bin Omaiya Ad- Damari and Salamah bin Abi\nSalamah to have been sent on an errand to kill Abu Sufyan, the chief of\nQuraish, who had already sent a bedouin to kill the Prophet [pbuh]. The two-\nmen mission failed except for three polytheists killed on the way. It is\nnoteworthy that all the foregone invasions did not imply real bitter fighting,\nthey were rather skirmishes or punitive military manoeuvres carried out to\ndeter some enemies still unsubdued. Deep meditation on the development of\nwar circumstances reveal the continuous collapse of the morale among the\nenemies of Islam, who had come to understand that they were no longer in a\nposition to contain the Islamic call or weaken its active drive. This state of\naffairs reached its climax in Al- Hudaibiyah Treaty when the two belligerent\nparties, believers and disbelievers, entered into a truce agreement that\n\n-- 211 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n212\npointed markedly to the ever- growing power of Islam, and recorded\nunequivocally the perpetuity of this heavenly religion in pan- Arabia.\n\n-- 212 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n213\nAl-Hudaibiyah Treaty\n(Dhul Qa‘dah 6 A.H.)\nWhen Arabia began to witness the large impressive sweep in favour of the Muslims,\nthe forerunners of the great conquest and success of the Islamic Call started\ngradually to loom on the demographic horizon, and the true believers restored their\nundisputed right to observe worship in the sacred sanctuary.\nIt was about the sixth year Hijri when the Prophet [pbuh] saw in a dream, while he\nwas still in Madinah, that he had entered the sacr",
  "ed sanctuary in Makkah in security\nwith his followers, and was performing the ceremonies of \t‘Umrah \t(lesser pilgrimage).\nTheir heads were being shaved and hair cut off. As soon as he informed some of his\nCompanions the contents of his dream, their hearts leapt up with joy since they\nfound in it the actualization of their deep longing to take part in pilgrimage and its\nhallowed rites after an exile of six years.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had his clothes washed, mounted his camel and marched out\ntowards Makkah at the head of fifteen hundred Muslims including his wife Umm\nSalamah. Some desert bedouins whose Faith was lukewarm hung back and made\nexcuses. They carried no weapons with them except sheathed swords because they\nhad no intention of fighting. Ibn Umm Maktum was mandated to dispose the affairs\nof Madinah during the Prophet’s absence. As they approached Makkah, and in a place\ncalled Dhi Hulaifa, he ordered that the sacrificial animals be garlanded, and all\nbelievers donned \tAl- Ihrâm, the pilgrim’s garb. He despatched a reconnoiterer to hunt\naround for news of the enemy. The man came back to tell the Prophet [pbuh] that a\nlarge number of slaves, as well as a huge army, were gathered to oppose him, and\nthat the road to Makkah was completely blocked. The Prophet [pbuh] consulted his\nCompanions, who were of the opinion that they would fight none unless they were\ndebarred from performing their pilgrimage.\nThe Quraishites, on their part, held a meeting during which they considered the\nwhole situation and decided to resist the Prophet’s mission at all costs. Two hundred\nhorsemen led by Khalid bin Al- Waleed were despatched to take the Muslims by\nsurprise during \tZuhr \t(the afternoon) prayer. However, the rules of prayer of fear\nwere revealed meanwhile and thus Khalid and his men missed the chance. The\nMuslims avoided marching on that way and decided to follow a rugged rocky one.\nHere, Khalid ran back to Quraish to brief them on the latest situation.\nWhen the Muslims reached a spot called Thaniyat Al- Marar, the Prophet’s camel\nstumbled and knelt down and was too stubborn to move. Muhammad [pbuh] swore\nhe would willingly accede to any plan they put forward that would glorify Allâh’s\nsanctities. He then reprovingly spurred his camel and it leapt up. They resumed their\nmarch and came to pitch their tents at the furthest part of Al- Hudaibiyah beside a\nwell of scanty water. The Muslims reported thirst to the Prophet [pbuh], who took an\narrow out of his quiver, and placed it in the ditch. Water immediately gushed forth,\nand his followers drank to their fill. When the Prophet [pbuh] had rested, Budail bin\nWarqa’ Al- Khuza‘i with some celebrities of Khuza‘ah tribe, the Prophet’s confidants,\ncame and asked him what he had come for. The Prophet [pbuh] replied that it was\nnot for war that he had come forth: \"I have no other design,\" he said, \"but to\nperform \t‘Umrah \t(the lesser pilgrimage) in the Holy Sanctuary. Should Quraish\nembrace the new religion, as some people have done, they are most welcome, but if\n\n-- 213 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n214\nthey stand in my way or debar the Muslims from pilgrimage, I will surely fight them\nto the last man, and Allâh’s Order must be fulfilled.\" The envoy carried the message\nback to Quraish, who sent another one called Mikraz bin Hafs. On seeing him, the\nProphet [pbuh] said that that was a treacherous man. He was given the same\nmessage to communicate to his people. He was followed by another ambassador\nknown as Al- Hulais bin ‘Alqamah. He was very much impressed by the spirit of\ndevotion that the Muslims had for the Sacred Ka‘bah. He went back to his men and\nwarned them against debarring Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions from doing\nhonour to Allâh’s house on the peril of breaking his alliance with them. Hulais was\nsucceeded by ‘Urwa bin Mas‘ud Ath- Thaqafi to negotiate with Muhammad [pbuh]. In\nthe course of discussion he said to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"Muhammad! Have you\ngathered around yourself mixed people and then brought them against your kith and\nkin in order to destroy them. By Allâh I think I see you deserted by these people\ntomorrow.\" At this point Abu Bakr stood up and expressed his resentment at this\nimputation. Al- Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah expressed the same attitude and reprovingly\nforbade him from touching the Prophet’s beard. Here, Quraish’s envoy remarked\nindignantly and alluded to the latter’s treacherous act of killing his companions and\nlooting them before he embraced Islam. Meanwhile, ‘Urwah, during his stay in the\nMuslim camp, had been closely watching the unfathomable love and profound\nrespect that the followers of Muhammad [pbuh] showed him. He returned and\nconveyed to Quraish his impression that those people could not forsake the Prophet\n[pbuh] under any circumstances. He expressed his feelings in the following words: \"I\nhave been to Chosroes, Caesar and Negus in their kingdoms, but never have I seen\na king among a people like Muhammad [pbuh] among his Companions. If he\nperforms his ablution, they would not let the water thereof fall on the ground; if he\nexpectorates, they would have the mucus to rub their faces with; if he speaks, they\nwould lower their voices. They will not abandon him for anything in any case. He,\nnow, offers you a reasonable plan, so do what you please.\"\nSeeing an overwhelming tendency towards reconciliation among their chiefs, some\nreckless, fight- prone youngsters of Quraish devised a wicked plan that could hinder\nthe peace treaty. They decided to infiltrate into the camp of the Muslims and produce\nintentional skirmishes that might trigger the fuse of war. Muhammad bin Maslamah,\nchief of the Muslim guards, took them captives, but in view of the far- reaching\nimminent results about to be achieved, the Prophet [pbuh] set them free. In this\ncontext Allâh says:\n\"And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from\nthem in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 48:24]\nTime passed. Negotiations went on but with no results. Then the Prophet [pbuh]\ndesired ‘Umar to see the nobles of Quraish on his behalf. ‘Umar excused himself on\naccount of the personal enmity of Quraish; he had, moreover, no influential relatives\nin the city who could shield him from danger; and he pointed to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan,\nwho belonged to one of the most powerful families in Makkah, as the suitable envoy.\n‘Uthman went to Abu Sufyan and other chiefs and told them that the Muslims had\ncome only to visit and pay their homage to the Sacred House, to do worship there,\nand that they had no intention to fight. He was also asked to call them to Islam, and\ngive glad tidings to the believers in Makkah, women and men, that the conquest was\napproaching and Islam was surely to prevail because Allâh would verily establish His\nreligion in Makkah. ‘Uthman also assured them that after the performance of\n\n-- 214 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n215\nceremonies they would soon depart peacefully, but the Quraishites were adamant\nand not prepared to grant them the permission to visit Al- Ka‘bah. They, however,\noffered ‘Uthman the permission to perform the pilgrimage, if he so desired in his\nindividual capacity, but ‘Uthman declined the offer saying: \"How is it possible that I\navail myself of this opportunity, when the Prophet [pbuh] is denied of it?\" The\nMuslims anxiously waited for the arrival of ‘Uthman with mingled feelings of fear and\nanxiety. But his arrival was considerably delayed and a foul play was suspected on\nthe part of Quraish. The Muslims were greatly worried and took a solemn pledge at\nthe hand of the Prophet [pbuh] that they would sacrifice their lives to avenge the\ndeath of their Companion and stand firmly by their master, Muhammad [pbuh],\nunder all conditions. This pledge goes by the name of \tBay‘at Ar- Ridwan \t(a covenant\nof fealty). The first men to take a pledge were Abu Sinan Al- Asadi and Salamah bin\nAl- Akwa‘, who gave a solemn promise to die in the cause of Truth three times, at the\nfront of the army, in the middle and in the rear. The Prophet [pbuh] caught his left\nhand on behalf of ‘Uthman. This fealty was sworn under a tree, with ‘Umar holding\nthe Prophet’s hand and Ma‘qil bin Yasar holding a branch of the tree up. The Noble\nQur’ân has referred to this pledge in the following words:\n\"Indeed, Allâh was pleased with the believers when they gave their \tBai‘a\n(pledge) to you (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) under the tree.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 48:18]\nWhen Quraish saw the firm determination of the Muslims to shed the last drop of\nblood for the defence of their Faith, they came to their senses and realized that\nMuhammad’s followers could not be cowed down by these tactics. After some further\ninterchange of messages they agreed to conclude a treaty of reconciliation and peace\nwith the Muslims. The clauses of the said treaty go as follows:\n1. \tThe Muslims shall return this time and come back next year, but they shall\nnot stay in Makkah for more than three days.\n2. \tThey shall not come back armed but can bring with them swords only\nsheathed in scabbards and these shall be kept in bags.\n3. \tWar activities shall be suspended for ten years, during which both parties will\nlive in full security and neither will raise sword against the other.\n4. \tIf anyone from Quraish goes over to Muhammad [pbuh] without his\nguardian’s permission, he should be sent back to Quraish, but should any of\nMuhammad’s followers return to Quraish, he shall not be sent back.\n5. \tWhosoever wishes to join Muhammad [pbuh], or enter into treaty with him,\nshould have the liberty to do so; and likewise whosoever wishes to join\nQuraish, or enter into treaty with them, should be allowed to do so.\nSome dispute arose with regard to the preamble. For example, when the agreement\nwas to be committed to writing, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, who acted as a scribe began with\nthe words: \tBismillâh ir- Rahman ir- Raheem, \ti.e., \"In the Name of Allâh, the Most\nBeneficent, the Most Merciful\" but the Makkan plenipotentiary, Suhail bin ‘Amr\ndeclared that he knew nothing about \tAr- Rahman \tand insisted upon the customary\nformula \tBi- ismika Allâhumma, \ti.e., \"In Your Name, O Allâh!\" The Muslims grumbled\nwith uneasiness but the Prophet [pbuh] agreed. He then went on to dictate, \"This is\nwhat Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh has agreed to with Suhail bin ‘Amr.\" Upon\nthis Suhail again protested: \"Had we acknowledged you as Prophet, we would not\nhave debarred you from the Sacred House, nor fought against you. Write your own\nname and the name of your father.\" The Muslims grumbled as before and refused to\n\n-- 215 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n216\nconsent to the change. The Prophet [pbuh], however, in the larger interest of Islam,\nattached no importance to such an insignificant detail, erased the words himself, and\ndictated instead: \"Muhammad, the son of ‘Abdullah.\" Soon after this treaty, Khuza‘a\nclan, a former ally of Banu Hashim, joined the ranks of Muhammad [pbuh], and Banu\nBakr sided with Quraish.\nIt was during this time while the treaty was being written that Abu Jandal, Suhail’s\nson, appeared on the scene. He was brutally chained and was staggering with\nprivation and fatigue. The Prophet [pbuh] and his Companions were moved to pity\nand tried to secure his release but Suhail was adamant and said: \"To signify that you\nare faithful to your contract, an opportunity has just arrived.\" The Prophet [pbuh]\nsaid: \"But the treaty was not signed when your son entered the camp.\" Upon this, he\nburst forth and said, \"but the terms of the treaty were agreed upon.\" It was indeed\nan anxious moment. On the one hand, Abu Jandal was lamenting at the top of his\nvoice, \"Am I to be returned to the polytheists that they might entice me from my\nreligion, O Muslims!\" but, on the other hand, the faithful engagement was also\nconsidered to be necessary, above all other considerations. The Prophet’s heart\nwelled up with sympathy, but he wanted to honour his word at all costs. He consoled\nAbu Jandal and said, \"Be patient, resign yourself to the Will of Allâh. Allâh is going to\nprovide for you and your helpless companions relief and means of escape. We have\nconcluded a treaty of peace with them and we have taken the pledge in the Name of\nAllâh. We are, therefore, under no circumstances prepared to break it.\" ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab could not help giving vent to the deep- seated agony of his heart. He rose to\nhis feet uttering words implying deep hatred and extreme indignation and requested\nAbu Jandal to take his sword and kill Suhail, but the son spared his father. However,\nin silent resignation was therefore, Abu Jandal borne away with his chains.\nWhen the peace treaty had been concluded, the Prophet [pbuh] ordered his\nCompanions to slaughter their sacrificial animals, but they were too depressed to do\nthat. The Prophet [pbuh] gave instructions in this regard three times but with\nnegative response. He told his wife Umm Salamah about this attitude of his\nCompanions. She advised that he himself take the initiative, slaughter his animal and\nhave his head shaved. Seeing that, the Muslims, with rended hearts, started to\nslaughter their animals and shave their heads. They even almost killed one another\nbecause of their distress. The Prophet [pbuh] prayed three times for those who\nshaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair. A camel was sacrificed on\nbehalf of seven men and a cow on behalf of the same number of people. The Prophet\n[pbuh] sacrificed a camel which once belonged to Abu Jahl and which the Muslims\nhad seized as booty at Badr, thus enraging the polytheists. During Al- Hudaibiyah\ncampaign, the Prophet [pbuh] permitted Ka‘b bin ‘Ujrah, who was in a state of \tIhram\n(state of ritual consecration of the pilgrim) for \t‘Umrah \t(lesser pilgrimage) to shave\nhis head due to illness, on the condition that he will pay compensation by sacrificing\na sheep, fasting for three days or feeding six needy persons. Concerning this, the\nfollowing verse was revealed:\n\"And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating\nshaving), he must pay a \tFidyah \t(ransom) of either fasting (three days) or\ngiving \tSadaqa \t(feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep).\"\n[Al- Qur'an 2:196]\n\n-- 216 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n217\nMeanwhile some believing women emigrated to Madinah and asked the Prophet\n[pbuh] for refuge which they were granted. When their families demanded their\nreturn, he would not hand them back because the following verse was revealed:\n\"O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants,\nexamine them, Allâh knows best as to their Faith, then if you know them for\ntrue believers, send them not back to the disbelievers, they are not lawful\n(wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for\nthem. But give the disbelievers that (amount of money) which they have\nspent [as their \tMahr] to them. And there will be no sin on you to marry\nthem if you have paid their \tMahr \tto them. Likewise hold not the disbelieving\nwomen as wives …\" \t[Al- Qur'an 60:10]\nThe reason why the believing women were not handed back was either because they\nwere not originally included in the terms of the treaty, which mentioned only men, or\nbecause the Qur’ân abrogated any terms dealing with women in the verse:\n\"O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the \tBai‘a\n(Pledge), that they will not associate anything in worship with Allâh …\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 60:12]\nThis is the verse which forbade Muslim women from marrying disbelieving men.\nLikewise, Muslim men were commanded to terminate their marriages to disbelieving\nwomen. In compliance with this injunction, ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab divorced two wives\nhe had married before he embraced Islam; Mu‘awiyah married the first woman, and\nSafwan bin Omaiyah married the second.\nAl-Hudaibiyah Treaty: Socio-political Impact\nA series of events confirmed the profound wisdom and splendid results of the peace\ntreaty which Allâh called \"a manifest victory\". How could it be otherwise when\nQuraish had recognized the legitimate Muslims’ existence on the scene of political life\nin Arabia, and began to deal with the believers on equal terms. Quraish in the light of\nthe articles of the treaty, had indirectly relinquished its claim to religious leadership,\nand admitted that they were no longer interested in people other than Quraish, and\nwashed their hands of any sort of intervention in the religious future of the Arabian\nPeninsula. The Muslims did not have in mind to seize people’s property or kill them\nthrough bloody wars, nor did they ever think of pursuing any coercive approaches in\ntheir endeavours to propagate Islam, on the contrary, their sole target was to\nprovide an atmosphere of freedom as regards ideology or religion:\n\"Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him\ndisbelieve.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 18:29]\nThe Muslims, on the other hand, had the opportunity to spread Islam over areas not\nthen explored. When there was armistice, war was abolished, and men met and\nconsulted together, none talked about Islam intelligently without entering it; within\nthe two years following the conclusion of the treaty double as many entered Islam as\never before. This is supported by the fact that the Prophet [pbuh] went out to Al-\nHudaibiyah with only 1,400 men, but when he set out to liberate Makkah, two years\nlater, he had 10,000 men with him.\n\n-- 217 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n218\nThe article of the treaty pertaining to cessation of hostilities for ten years points\ndirectly to the utter failure of political haughtiness exercised by Quraish and its allies,\nand functions as evidence of the collapse and impotence of the war instigator.\nQuraish had been obliged to lose those advantages in return for one seemingly in its\nfavour but does not actually bear any harm against the Muslims, i.e., the article that\nspeaks of handing over believing men who seek refuge with the Muslims without\ntheir guardians’ consent to Quraish. At first glance, it was a most distressing clause\nand was considered objectionable in the Muslim camp. However, in the course of\nevents, it proved to be a great blessing. The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not\nlikely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims turned\nout to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think that they would\nbecome apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this truce assumed its full\ndimensions in some subsequent events. After the Prophet [pbuh] had reached\nMadinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped from Quraish, came to him as a Muslim;\nQuraish sent two men demanding his return, so the Prophet [pbuh] handed him over\nto them. On the way to Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the\nother one fled to Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet\n[pbuh], he said, \"Your obligation is over and Allâh has freed you from it. You duly\nhanded me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them.\" The Prophet\n[pbuh] said, \"Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been\nothers with him.\" When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to\nthem, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al- Bahr. The other Muslims\nwho were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by\nAbu Jandal and others until a fair- sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge\non Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah finding\nthemselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet [pbuh] to do\naway with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh\nand by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the\nMuslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet [pbuh] sent for the\ngroup and they responded, as expected, positively.\nThese are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all\nfunction in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty\nmade it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not given access to the Holy\nSanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation\nwith the pagans of Quraish. ‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking\nfull grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet [pbuh] and said: \"Aren’t you the true\nMessenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied calmly, \"Why not?\" ‘Umar again\nspoke and asked: \"Aren’t we on the path of righteousness and our enemies in the\nwrong?\" Without showing any resentment, the Prophet [pbuh] replied that it was so.\nOn getting this reply he further urged: \"Then we should not suffer any humiliation in\nthe matter of Faith.\" The Prophet [pbuh] was unruffled and with perfect confidence\nsaid: \"I am the true Messenger of Allâh, I never disobey Him, He shall help me.\" \"Did\nyou not tell us,\" rejoined ‘Umar, \"that we shall perform pilgrimage?\" \"But I have\nnever told you,\" replied the Prophet [pbuh], \"that we shall do so this very year.\"\n‘Umar was silenced. But his mind was disturbed. He went to Abu Bakr and expressed\nhis feelings before him. Abu Bakr who had never been in doubt as regards the\nProphet’s truthfulness and veracity confirmed what the Prophet [pbuh] had told him.\nIn due course the Chapter of Victory (48th) was revealed saying:\n\n-- 218 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n219\n\"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) a manifest victory.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 48:1]\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned ‘Umar and imported to him the happy\ntidings. ‘Umar was overjoyed, and greatly regretted his former attitude. He used to\nspend in charity, observe fasting and prayer and free as many slaves as possible in\nexpiation for that reckless attitude he had assumed. \t[Fath Al-Bari 7/439-458; Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/378-\n381]\nThe early part of the year 7 A.H. witnessed the Islamization of three prominent men\nof Makkah, ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As, Khalid bin Al- Waleed and ‘Uthman bin Talhah. On their\narrival and entrance into the fold of Islam, the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Quraish has\ngiven us its own blood.\"\n\n-- 219 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n220\nThe Second Stage: A New Phase of Islamic Action\nAl- Hudaibiyah Truce marked a new phase in the process of Islamic action and life of\nthe Muslims. Quraish, a bitter enemy of Islam, now withdraws from the war arena\nand embraces a peaceful settlement with the Muslims, thus the third support of a\ntripartite enemy (Quraish, Ghatfan and the Jews) is broken, and being the holder of\nthe banner of paganism in Arabia, the other pagans’ aggressive feelings towards\nIslam considerably subsided. Ghatfan Tribe no longer constituted any remarkable\nthreat, and their provocative deeds were mainly Jewish- instigated actions. The Jews,\nafter being banished from Madinah, resorted to Khaibar to change it into a hot bed of\nintrigues against the Prophet [pbuh]. There, they used to hatch their plots, ignite the\nfire of dissension and allure the Arabs living in the vicinity of Madinah to join them\nwith the aim of exterminating the new Islamic state, or at least inflict heavy losses\non the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] , not heedless of their devilish schemes, placed\na decisive war with them as a first priority on his agenda shortly after the\nendorsement of the above- mentioned treaty. The treaty of Hudaibiyah allowed the\nMuslims to intensify their Islamic career and double up their ceaseless efforts in\npropagating their \tDa‘wah, and consequently give this sort of action preponderance\nover the military activities. Hence, we deem it imperative to divide this post- treaty\nstage into two sections:\n1. \tCeaseless peaceful efforts in propagating the Islamic \tDa‘wah \t(Call) and\ninitiating a sort of correspondence with kings and princes of the neighbouring\npolitical entities.\n2. \tMilitary activities.\n\n-- 220 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n221\nThe Prophet’s Plans to spread the Message of Islam beyond Arabia\nLate in the six year A.H., on his return from Hudaibiyah, the Prophet [pbuh] decided\nto send messages to the kings beyond Arabia calling them to Islam. In order to\nauthenticate the credentials of his envoys, a silver seal was made in which were\ngraven the words: \"Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh\" in the following formation:\n[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/872,873]\n[Picture not given right now - will be added later]\nEnvoys were chosen on the basis of their experience and knowledge, and sent on\ntheir errands in Muharram in the year 7 A.H., a few days before heading for Khaibar.\n[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/171]\n1. A Deputation to Abyssinia (Ethiopia)\nNegus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), his name was Ashama bin Al- Abjar, received the\nProphet’s message, despatched by Amr bin Omaiyah Ad- Damari, which At- Tabari\nreferred to, either late in the sixth year or early in the seventh year A.H. Deep\nscrutiny into the letter shows that it was not the one sent after Al- Hudaibiyah event.\nWording of the letter rather indicates that it was sent to that king when Ja‘far and his\ncompanions emigrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) during the Makkan period. One of its\nsentences read \"I have despatched my cousin, Ja‘far with a group of Muslims, to\nyou. Do be generous towards them and give up haughtiness.\"\nAl- Baihaqi, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, gave the following narration of the\nProphet’s letter sent to Negus:\n\"This letter is sent from Muhammad, the Prophet to Negus Al- Ashama, the king of\nAbyssinia (Ethiopia).\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance and believes in Allâh and His\nMessenger. I bear witness that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, He\nhas taken neither a wife nor a son, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.\nI call you unto the fold of Islam; if you embrace Islam, you will find safety,\n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and\nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we\nw orship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and\nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn\naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:64]\nShould you reject this invitation, then you will be held responsible for all the evils of\nthe Christians of your people.\"\nDr. Hameedullah (Paris), a reliable verifier, has adduced a version of the above letter\ndisclosed only a short time ago and identical to Ibn Al- Qaiyim’s narration. Dr.\nHameedullah exerted painstaking effort and used all means of modern technology to\nverify the text of the letter, which reads as follows:\n\n-- 221 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n222\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia).\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Salutations, I entertain Allâh’s praise,\nthere is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of peace, the Giver of\npeace, the Guardian of faith, the Preserver of safety. I bear witness that Jesus, the\nson of Mary, is the spirit of Allâh and His Word which He cast into Mary, the virgin,\nthe good, the pure, so that she conceived Jesus. Allâh created him from His spirit\nand His breathing as He created Adam by His Hand. I call you to Allâh Alone with no\nassociate and to His obedience and to follow me and to believe in that which came to\nme, for I am the Messenger of Allâh. I invite you and your men to Allâh, the\nGlorious, the All- Mighty. I hereby bear witness that I have communicated my\nmessage and advice. I invite you to listen and accept my advice. Peace be upon him\nwho follows true guidance.\" [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/60]\nThe text of this letter is doubtlessly authentic, but to maintain that it was written\nafter Al- Hudaibiyah event is still a question lacking in definite evidence.\nWhen ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad- Damari communicated the Apostolic letter to Negus, the\nlatter took the parchment and placed it on his eye, descended to the floor, confessed\nhis faith in Islam and wrote the following reply to the Prophet [pbuh]:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Negus Ashama to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh. Peace be upon you, O\nMessenger of Allâh! and mercy and blessing from Allâh beside Whom there is no god.\nI have received your letter in which you have mentioned about Jesus and by the Lord\nof heaven and earth, Jesus is not more than what you say. We fully acknowledge\nthat with which you have been sent to us and we have entertained your cousin and\nhis companions. I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allâh, true and\nconfirming (those who have gone before you), I pledge to you through your cousin\nand surrender myself through him to the Lord of the worlds.\" [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had asked Negus to send Ja‘far and his companions, the\nemigrants to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), back home. They came back to see the Prophet\n[pbuh] in Khaibar. Negus later died in Rajab 9 A.H. shortly after Tabuk \tGhazwa. The\nProphet [pbuh] announced his death and observed prayer in absentia for him.\nAnother king succeeded Negus to the throne and another letter was sent to him by\nthe Prophet [pbuh] but whether or not he embraced Islam is still a question not\nanswered yet. \t[Sahih Muslim 2/99]\n2. Letter to the Vicegerent of Egypt, called Muqawqas\nThe Prophet [pbuh] wrote to Juraij bin Matta[Rahmat- al- lil'alameen 1/178; Dr. Hamidullah said\nthat his name was Binyamin] , called Muqawqas, vicegerent of Egypt and Alexandria saying:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad slave of Allâh and His Messenger to Muqawqas, vicegerent of\nEgypt.\n\n-- 222 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n223\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Thereafter, I invite you to accept\nIslam. Therefore, if you want security, accept Islam. If you accept Islam, Allâh, the\nSublime, shall reward you doubly. But if you refuse to do so, you will bear the\nburden of the transgression of all the Copts.\n\"Say (O Muhammad ([pbuh]: ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and\nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we\nworship none but Allâh, and that we as",
  "sociate no partners with Him, and\nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn\naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:64]\nHatib bin Abi Balta‘a, who was chosen to communicate the message, requested an\naudience with Muqawqas before imparting the contents of the letter. He addressed\nEgypt’s vicegerent saying: \"There used to be someone before you who had arrogated\nthe status of the Supreme Lord, so Allâh punished him and made an example of him\nin the Hereafter, and in this life; therefore, take warning and never set a bad\nexample to others.\" Muqawqas answered: \"We are in no position to relinquish our\nreligion except for a better one.\" Hatib resumed: \"We invite you to embrace Islam,\nwhich will suffice you all what you may lose. Our Prophet has called people to profess\nthis Faith, Quraish and the Jews stood against him as bitter enemies, whereas\nChristians stood closest to his Call. Upon my life, Moses’s news about Christ is\nidentical to the latter’s good tidings about the advent of Muhammad; likewise, this\ninvitation of ours to you to embrace Islam is similar to your invitation to the people\nof Torah to accept the New Testament. Once a Prophet rises in a nation, he is eligible\nfor positive response, hence you are subject to the same Divine Law. Bear in mind\nthat we have not come to dissuade you from religion of Christ but rather bidding you\nto adhere to its tenets.\" Muqawqas meditated over the contents of the letter deeply\nand said: \"I have come to the conviction that this Prophet bids nothing abominable;\nhe is neither a straying magician nor a lying soothsayer. He bears the true manifest\nseeds of Prophethood, and so I will consider the affair deeply.\" He took the\nparchment and ordered that it be kept in an ivory casket. He called a scribe to write\nthe following reply in Arabic:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muqawqas to Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah.\nPeace be upon you. I have read your letter and understood its contents, and what\nyou are calling for. I already know that the coming of a Prophet is still due, but I\nused to believe he would be born in Syria. I am sending you as presents two maids,\nwho come from noble Coptic families; clothing and a steed for riding on. Peace be\nupon you.\"\nIt is noteworthy that Muqawqas did not avail himself of this priceless opportunity and\nhe did not embrace Islam. The presents were accepted; Maria, the first maid, stayed\nwith the Prophet \t[pbuh], and gave birth to his son Ibrahîm; the other Sirin, was\ngiven to Hassan bin Thabit Al- Ansari.\n\n-- 223 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n224\n3. A Letter to Chosroes, Emperor of Persia\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh to Chosroes, king of Persia.\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in Allâh and His Messenger\nand testifies that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, and that\nMuhammad is His slave and Messenger. I invite you to accept the religion of Allâh.

Accept Islam as your religion so that you may live in security, otherwise,\nyou will be responsible for all the sins of the Magians.\"\n‘Abdullah bin Hudhafa As- Sahmi was chosen to carry the letter. This envoy carried it\nto the king of Bahrain but we do not know as yet if the latter despatched to Chosroes\nby one of his men or chose ‘Abdullah himself.\nThe proud monarch was enraged by the style of the letter as the name of the\nProphet [pbuh] had been put above his own name. He tore the letter into shreds and\nforthwith dictated a command to his viceroy in Yemen to send a couple of troopers to\narrest the Prophet and bring him to his presence. The governor, Bazan by name,\nimmediately sent two men to Madinah for the purpose. As soon as the men reached\nMadinah, the Prophet \t[pbuh] \twas informed by a Divine Revelation that Pervez, the\nemperor of Persia, had been murdered by his son. The Prophet [pbuh] disclosed to\nthem the news and they were stunned. He added asking them to tell their new\nmonarch that Islam would prevail everywhere and outstrip the sovereignty of\nChosroes himself. They hurried back to Bazan and communicated to him what they\nheard. Meanwhile, Sherweh, the new monarch sent a letter to Bazan confirming the\nnews and bidding him to stop any procedures as regards the Prophet till further\nnotice. Bazan, together with the Persians in Yemen, went into the folds of Islam, and\ngladly signified his adhesion to the Prophet. \t[Fath Al-Bari 8/127,128]\n4. The Envoy to Caesar, King of Rome\nAl- Bukhari gave a long narration of the contents of the letter sent by the Prophet\n[pbuh] to Hercules, king of the Byzantines:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad, the slave of Allâh and His Messenger to Hercules, king of the\nByzantines.\nBlessed are those who follow true guidance. I invite you to embrace Islam so that\nyou may live in security. If you come within the fold of Islam, Allâh will give you\ndouble reward, but in case you turn your back upon it, then the burden of the sins of\nall your people shall fall on your shoulders.\n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and\nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we\nworship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and\n\n-- 224 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n225\nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn\naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:64] [Sahih Al-Bukhari\n1/4,5]\nThe Muslim envoy, Dihyah bin Khalifah Al- Kalbi, was ordered to hand the letter over\nto king of Busra, who would in turn, send it to Caesar.\nIncidentally, Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who by that time had not embraced Islam, was\nsummoned to the court and Hercules asked him many questions about Muhammad\n[pbuh] and the religion which he preached. The testimony which this avowed enemy\nof the Prophet gave regarding the personal excellence of the Prophet’s character and\nthe good that Islam was doing the human race, left Hercules wonder- struck.\nAl- Bukhâri, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, narrated that Hercules sent for Abu\nSufyan and his companions, who happened to be trading in Ash- Sham, Jerusalem.\nThat was during the truce that had been concluded between the polytheists of\nQuraish and the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Hercules, seated amongst his chiefs of\nstaff, asked, \"Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a\nProphet?\" \"I (Abu Sufyan) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst\nthe group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind\nme. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). ‘Tell them (i.e. Abu\nSufyan’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that\nmen who claims to be a Prophet. So if he tells a lie, they should contradict him\n(instantly)’. By Allâh had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a\nliar, I would have told lies\", Abu Sufyan later said.\nAbu Sufyan’s testimony went as follows: \"Muhammad descends from a noble family.\nNo one of his family happened to assume kingship. His followers are those deemed\nweak with numbers ever growing. He neither tells lies nor betrays others, we fight\nhim and he fights us but with alternate victory. He bids people to worship Allâh Alone\nwith no associate, and abandon our fathers’ beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer,\nhonesty, abstinence and maintain strong family ties.\" \"Hercules, on hearing this\ntestimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his following\nimpression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of Muhammad’s\nProphethood: ‘I fully realize that Prophets come from noble families; he does not\naffect any previous example of Prophethood. Since none of his ancestors was a\nmonarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s\nmonarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to people, he is for the more reason,\nimmune to telling lies as regards Allâh. Concerning his followers being those deemed\nweak with numbers ever growing, it is something that goes in agreement with\nquestions of Faith until this latter assumes its full dimensions geographically and\ndemographically. I have understood that no instance of apostasy has as yet\nappeared among his followers, and this points to the bliss of Faith that finds its\nabode in the human heart. Betrayal, as I see, is alien to him because real Prophets\nhold betrayal in abhorrence. Bidding worship of Allâh with no associates, observance\nof prayer, honesty and abstinence and prohibition of paganism are traits bound to\nsubject to him all my possessions. I have already known that a Prophet must arise\nbut it has never occurred to me that he will be an Arab from among you. If I was\nsure I would be faithful to him, I might hope to meet him, and if I were with him, I\nwould wash his feet.’ Hercules then requested that the Prophet’s letter be read. The\nobservations of the emperor and finally the definite and clear- cut exposition of the\nIslamic message could not but create a tense atmosphere amongst the clergy\npresent at the court. We were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"While coming\n\n-- 225 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n226\nout, I said to my companions, ‘The matter of Ibn Abi Kabshah (i.e. Muhammad\n[pbuh]) has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al- Asfar (i.e. the\nRomans) is afraid of him.’ So I continued to believe that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh]\nwould be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islam.\" The king did not embrace\nIslam — for it was differently ordained. However, the Muslim envoy was returned to\nMadinah with the felicitations of the emperor.\nOn his way back to Madinah, Dihyah Al- Kalbi was intercepted by people from Judham\ntribe in Hasmi, who looted the presents sent to the Prophet \t[pbuh]. Zaid bin Haritha\nat the head of five hundred men was despatched to that spot, inflicted heavy losses\non those people and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and a hundred\nwomen and boys. The chief of Judham who had embraced Islam filed a complaint\nwith the Prophet, who gave a positive response to the former’s protest, and ordered\nthat all the spoils and captives be returned.\n5. A Letter to Mundhir bin Sawa, Governor of Bahrain\nThe Prophet [pbuh] despatched ‘Al- ‘Ala’ bin Al- Hadrami to the governor of Bahrain,\ncarrying a letter inviting him to embrace Islam. In reply, Al- Mundhir bin Sawa wrote\nthe following letter:\n\"Allâh’s Messenger \t[pbuh]! I received your injunctions. Prior to this, I read your\nletter, which you wrote to the people of Bahrain extending to them an invitation to\nIslam. Islam appealed to some of them and they entered the fold of Islam, while\nothers did not find it appealing. In my country, there live Magians and Jews, and\ntherefore you may inform me of the treatment to be extended to them.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] wrote the following letter in reply to his:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Mundhir bin Sawa.\nPeace be on you! I praise Allâh with no associate, and I bear witness that\nMuhammad is His slave and Messenger.\nThereafter, I remind you of Allâh, the Mighty, the Glorious. Whoever accepts\nadmonition, does it for his own good. Whoever follows my messengers and acts in\naccordance with their guidance, he, in fact, accepts my advice.\nMy messengers have highly praised your behaviour. You shall continue in your\npresent office. Give the new Muslims full chance to preach their religion. I accept\nyour recommendation regarding the people of Bahrain, and I pardon the offences of\nthe offenders; therefore, you may also forgive them.\nOf the people of Bahrain whoever wants to go on in their Jewish or Magian faith,\nshould be made to pay \tJizya \t(poll- tax).\" [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61,62]\n\n-- 226 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n227\n6. A Letter to Haudha bin ‘Ali, Governor of Yamama\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Haudha bin ‘Ali.\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall\nprevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command\nshall remain yours.\"\nThe envoy chosen was Sulait bin ‘Amr Al- ‘Amiri, who after communicating his\nmessage, carried back the following reply to the Prophet \t[pbuh]:\n\"The Faith, to which you invite me, is very good. I am a famous orator and poet, the\nArabs highly respect me and I am of account among them. If you include me in your\ngovernment, I am prepared to follow you.\"\nThe governor then bestowed a reward on Sulait and presented him with clothes\nmade of Hajr fabric. Of course, he put all those presents in the trust of the Prophet\n[pbuh].\nThe Prophet [pbuh] did not accept Haudha’s demand. He usually turned down such\nperemptory tone, and would say that the whole matter was in the Hand of Allâh,\nWho gave His land to whoever He desired. Gabriel later came with the Revelation\nthat Haudha had died. The Prophet [pbuh], in the context of his comment on this\nnews, said: \"Yamama is bound to give rise to a liar who will arrogate Prophethood to\nhimself but he will subsequently be killed.\" In reply to a question relating to the\nidentity of the killer, the Prophet said \"It is one of you, followers of Islam.\" [Za'd Al-Ma'ad\n3/63]\n7. A Letter to Harith bin Abi Shamir Al-Ghassani, King of Damascus\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Al- Harith bin Abi Shamir.\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in it and regards it as true. I\ninvite you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate, thenceafter your kingdom will\nremain yours.\"\nShuja‘ bin Wahab had the honour of taking the letter to Harith, who upon hearing\nthe letter read in his audience, was madly infuriated and uttered: \"Who dares to\ndisposs me of my country, I’ll fight him (the Prophet),\" and arrogantly rejected the\nProphet’s invitation to the fold of Islam. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/62; Muhadarat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah\n1/146]\n8. A Letter to the King of ‘Oman, Jaifer, and his Brother ‘Abd Al-Jalandi\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nFrom Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah to Jaifer and ‘Abd Al- Jalandi.\n\n-- 227 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n228\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance; thereafter I invite both of you to the\nCall of Islam. Embrace Islam. Allâh has sent me as a Prophet to all His creatures in\norder that I may instil fear of Allâh in the hearts of His disobedient creatures so that\nthere may be left no excuse for those who deny Allâh. If you two accept Islam, you\nwill remain in command of your country; but if you refuse my Call, you’ve got to\nremember that all your possessions are perishable. My horsemen will appropriate\nyour land, and my Prophethood will assume preponderance over your kingship.\"\n‘Amr bin Al- ’As, who was chosen to carry the letter, narrated the following story that\nhappened before he was admitted into the audience of Jaifer.\n\"When I arrived in ‘Oman I contacted ‘Abd, who was known to be more mild-\ntempered than his brother:\n‘Amr: I am the messenger of Allâh’s Prophet coming to see both, you and your\nbrother.\n‘Abd: You have to see my brother and read to him the letter you are carrying. He is\nmy senior in both age and kingship. Incidentally, what is the purport of your\nmission?\n‘Amr: The Prophet calls upon you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate, discard\nany other deities and testify to the slavehood and Messengership of Muhammad.\n‘Abd: O ‘Amr! You come from a noble family, but first of all, tell me what was your\nfather’s attitude concerning this Faith? You know, we used to follow his steps.\n‘Amr: Death overtook him before believing in Muhammad’s mission; I wish now he\nhad embraced Islam and been truthful to it before his death. I myself had adopted\nthe same attitude until Allâh guided me towards Islam.\n‘Abd: When did you embrace Islam?\n‘Amr: When I was at Negus’s court. By the way, the latter did also enter into the fold\nof Islam.\n‘Abd: What was his people’s reaction?\n‘Amr: They approved of him and followed his steps.\n‘Abd: The bishops and monks?\n‘Amr: They did the same.\n‘Abd: Beware ‘Amr of lying for this soon betrays man.\n‘Amr: I never tell lies; moreover, our religion never allows it.\n‘Abd: Has Hercules been informed of the Islamization of Negus?\n\n-- 228 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n229\n‘Amr: Yes, of course.\n‘Abd: How did you happen to know that?\n‘Amr: Negus used to pay land tax to Hercules, but when the former embraced Islam,\nhe swore he would discontinue that tax. When this news reached Hercules, his\ncourtiers urged him to take action against Negus but he refused and added that he\nhimself would do the same if he were not sparing of his kingship.\n‘Abd: What does your Prophet exhort you to do?\n‘Amr: He exhorts us to obey Allâh, the All- Mighty, the All- Glorious, be pious and\nmaintain good ties with family kin; he forbids disobedience, aggression, adultery,\nwine, idolatry and devotion to the cross.\n‘Abd: Fair words and fair beliefs are those you are calling for. I wish my brother\nwould follow me to believe in Muhammad \t[pbuh] \tand profess his religion, but my\nbrother is too sparing of his kingship to become a subordinate.\n‘Amr: Should your brother surrender himself to Islam, the Prophet would give him\nauthority over his people and take alms tax from the wealthy people to be given to\nthe needy.\n‘Abd: That is fair behaviour. But what is this alms tax you have mentioned?\n‘Amr: It is a Divine injunction that alms tax be taken from the well- to- do people who\nhave surplus wealth and be distributed to the poor.\n‘Abd: I doubt if this can work among our people.\n‘Amr stayed for some days to be admitted into Jaifer’s court until he was finally\ngranted this permit. \"He asked me to hand him the letter to read it. After that he\nasked me how Quraish reacted and I answered that they had followed him, some out\nof their own freewill and others overpowered by military fighting. Now, people have\nchosen Islam in preference to other creeds, and have realized through their mental\ninsight that they had been straying in darkness. None, except you, is now out of the\ndomain of Islam, so I advise you to embrace Islam so that you can provide security\nto yourself and your country.\"\nHere, he asked me to call on him the following day. The following day he showed\nsome reluctance in receiving me but his brother, ‘Abd, interceded and I was given\nthe chance to see him again but this time to address me in a threatening arrogant\ntone. However, after a private talk with his brother and reconsidering the whole\nsituation, both brothers embraced Islam and proved to be true to Islam that had\nbegun to make its way into this new area.\nThe context of this story reveals that this letter was sent at a much later date than\nthe others, most likely after the conquest of Makkah.\nThrough these letters, the Prophet managed to communicate his Message to most\nmonarchs at that time; some believed, while others remained obdurate and persisted\n\n-- 229 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n230\nin their disbelief. However, the idea of embracing Islam, and the advent of a new\nProphet preoccupied all of them.\n\n-- 230 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n231\nPost-Hudaibiyah Hostilities\nDhu Qarad Invasion\nIt was in fact not a battle but rather a skirmish carried out against a platoon of Bani\nFazarah. The place by which it was fought is known as Dhu Qarad, a reservoir of\nwater at a day’s journey from Madinah. According to the majority of scholars, this\nincident took place three days before the battle of Khaibar.\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Salamah bin Al- Akwa‘, the hero of this\nbattle, that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent his hireling Rabah, with his camels to\na nearby pasture. I, taking Talhah’s horse, went there for the same purpose. When\nthe day dawned, ‘Abdur Rahman Al- Fazari made a raid, drove away all the camels,\nand killed the man who looked after them. I told Rabah to ride the horse, take it to\nTalhah and inform the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] that the polytheists had made\naway with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Madinah,\nshouted thrice: \"Come to our help!\" After that I set out in pursuit of the raiders,\nshooting at them with arrows and chanting (self- eulogatory) verse:\nI am the son of Al- Akwa‘\nToday is the day of defeat for the mean.\nBy Allâh, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a\nhorseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree (hid myself) sitting at its base,\nshoot at him and hamstring his horse. At last they entered a narrow mountain gorge.\nI ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued\nto chase them in this way until I got all the camels released with no one left with\nt hem. They fled in all directions and I following and shooting at them continually\nuntil they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances, lightening their\nburden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with a stone so that the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] and his Companions might recognize them (that it was\nbooty left by the enemy). They went on until they came to a narrow valley. They sat\ndown to eat something, and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Four of them\nascended the mountain coming towards me. When they were near enough to hear\nme, I shouted: \"Do you recognize me?\" They said: \"No. Who are you?\" I said: \"I am\nSalamah son of Al- Akwa‘. I can kill anyone of you I like but none of you can kill me.\"\nSo they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], who came riding through the trees. The foremost among\nthem was Akhram, behind him was Abu Qatadah Al- Ansari followed by Al- Miqdad bin\nAl- Aswad. Akhram and ‘Abdur Rahman Al- Fazari met in combat. Akhram hamstrung\n‘Abdur Rahman’s horse but the latter managed to strike him with his lance and kill\nhim. ‘Abdur Rahman turned around riding Akhram’s horse. Abu Qatadah, seeing this,\ngot engaged in fierce combat with ‘Abdur Rahman, smote him with his lance and it\nwas fatal. The polytheists consequently fled away and I was in their pursuit until\nbefore sunset they reached a valley with a spring of water called Dhu Qarad. They\nrested there to have a drink. I however, running in hot pursuit, turned them out of\nthe valley before they could drink a drop of water. Later on, the Prophet [pbuh],\nalong with his Companions, overtook me. I addressed him saying: Messenger of\nAllâh, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the\nmarauders and finish them. In reply, the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Ibn Al- Akwa‘, you\nhave taken enough and so now you have to show magnanimity; now they have\nreached the habitation of Ghatfan where they are being feted.\" He added saying:\n\n-- 231 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n232\n\"Our best horseman today is Abu Qatadah, and our best footman today is Salamah.\"\nHe allotted me two shares of the booty - the share meant for the horseman and the\nother meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return\nto Madinah, he made me mount behind him on his she- camel called Al- ‘Adba’.\n\n-- 232 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n233\nThe Conquest of Khaibar\n(In Moharram, 7A.H.)\nKhaibar was a spacious strongly fortified territory, studded with castles and farms,\nlying at a distance of 60- 80 miles north of Madinah, now a village known for its\nuncongenial climate. After Al- Hudaibiyah Treaty, the major party of the anti- Islam\ntripartite coalition — Quraish, the bedouin horde of Najd tribes and the Jews — was\nneutralized, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it an appropriate time to settle\nhis affairs with the other two wings — the Jews and the Najd tribes — in order that\npeace and security could prevail and the Muslims may devote their time and effort in\npropagating the Message of Allâh and calling people to embrace it. Khaibar itself had\nalways remained a hotbed of intrigue and conspiracy, and the Jews had always\nconstituted it a source of military provocations and war instigation centre, so it was\ngiven a top priority on the agenda of the Prophet’s compelling exigencies. The Jews\nof Khaibar had united by an ancient alliance with the Confederates, triggered Bani\nQuraiza to practise treachery, maintained contacts with Ghatfan and the Arabians\nand they even devised an attempt at the Prophet’s life. In fact, the continual\nafflictions that the Muslims had sustained were primarily attributable to the Jews.\nEnvoys were repeatedly sent to them for peaceful settlement, but all in vain.\nConsequently the Prophet [pbuh] came to the conclusion that a military campaign\nwas a must in order to forestall their hostilities.\nInterpreters of the Noble Qur’ân suggest that capturing Khaibar had been a Divine\npromise implied in Allâh’s Words:\n\"Allâh has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, and He has\nhastened for you this.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 48:20]\ni.e., Al- Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty and the surrender of Khaibar.\nThe hypocrites and people weak of heart had hung back from joining the true\nMuslims in Al- Hudaibiyah campaigns, so now Allâh, the All- Mighty inculcated the\nfollowing words in His Prophet’s ears:\n\"Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils,\n‘Allow us to follow you.’ They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: ‘You shall\nnot follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand.’ Then they will say: ‘Nay, you\nenvy us.’ Nay, but they understand not except a little.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 48:15]\nFor this reason, the Prophet [pbuh] invited only those who were willing to fight in the\ncause of Allâh to accompany him in his march against Khaibar. 1400 men only, who\nhad sworn allegiance in response to his call.\nMeanwhile, Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al- Ghifari was chosen to run the affairs of Madinah.\nAnother incident of high significance is noteworthy, namely the Islamization of Abu\nHuraira, a venerable Muslim scholar and an authentic narrator of the Prophetic\ntraditions.\nThe hypocrites of Arabia took notice of the fresh Islamic intentions so they began to\nalert the Jews to the imminent military activities. Their chief, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai\n\n-- 233 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n234\ndelegated an envoy to the Jews of Khaibar warning them against the dangers\napproaching, and nerving them to resist the Muslims as they outnumbered the latter\nand were better equipped. On hearing the news the Jews despatched Kinanah bin Abi\nAl- Huqaiq and Haudha bin Qais to their former allies, the tribe of Ghatfan requesting\nmilitary assistance, promising to grant them half the yield of the fruit that their\nfarms could yield if they managed to beat the Muslims.\nThe Prophet marched by way of Isra Mountain and then went forward with the army\ntill he halted in a valley called Ar- Raji‘, encamping between Khaibar and Ghatfan so\nas to prevent the latter from reinforcing the Jews. The guides accompanying him led\nhim to an intersection from which branched out three roads with different\ndesignations; all leading to his destination. He abstained from following the first two\nroads on grounds of their ominous designation and chose the third for its propitious\nindications.\nIt is noteworthy that some interesting incidents featured the Muslims’ march towards\nKhaibar; of which we mention the following:\n1. \tIt has been narrated on the authority of Salamah bin Al- Akwa‘, who said: We\nmarched upon Khaibar with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. We journeyed\nduring the night. One of the men said to my brother ‘Amir: Won’t you recite\nto us some of your verses, ‘Amir? So he began to chant his verses to urge the\ncamels, reciting:\nO Allâh, if You had not guided us,\nWe would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity, nor offered prayers.\nWe wish to lay down our lives for You; so forgive You our lapses,\nAnd keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies).\nBestow upon us peace and tranquility,\nBehold, when with a cry they called upon us to help\n2. \tThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Who is this driver (of the camels)?\"\nThey said: \"It is ‘Amir.\" He said: \"Allâh will show mercy to him.\" A man said:\n\"Martyrdom is reserved for him; O Messenger of Allâh, would that you had\nallowed us to benefit ourselves from his life.\" [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/603; Sahih Muslim\n2/115] \tThe Prophet’s Companions had already known that he would never\ninvoke Allâh’s mercy upon a close Companion but to single him out for\nmartyrdom.[Sahih Muslim 2/115]\n3. \tOn their way down a valley, the Muslims began to entertain Allâh’s\nGreatness: shouting at the top of their voices: \"Allâh is Great, Allâh is Great,\nthere is no god but Allâh.\" The Prophet \t[pbuh] \tasked them to lower down\ntheir voices saying: \"The One you are invoking is neither absent nor deaf; He\nis close to you, All- hearing. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/605] \t\"\n4. \tIn a spot called As- Sahba’, not far from Khaibar, the Prophet \t[pbuh]\nobserved the afternoon prayer, then he called his Companions to have\nwhatever food provisions they had. What they brought was too scanty to\nsatisfy them all. The Prophet took it by his hand and it immediately grew in\nquantity, so they all ate to their fill. Shortly afterward, he and the others,\nrinsed their mouths and performed the evening prayer without ablution \t[Sahih\nAl- Bukhari 2/603] ; he did the same for the night prayer [Maghazi Al- Waqidi\np.112].\n\n-- 234 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n235\nThe following morning, at sunrise, the Muslims encountered the Jews when they had\ncome out about their jobs with their axes, spades and strings driving their cattle\nalong. They began to shout in surprise: \"Muhammad has come along with his force!\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Allâh is Great, Khaibar shall face destruction.\nBehold! When we descend in the city centre, it will be a bad day for those who have\nbeen warned (but have not taken",
  " heed). [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/603, 604]\"\nFor encampment, the Prophet \t[pbuh] \thad chosen a certain plot of land he deemed\nsuitable to serve as the headquarters of his army. However, a veteran fighter of his\ncalled Hubab bin Al- Mundhir suggested that they, under the exigencies of war\nrequirements and for the sake of providing maximum logistic facilities, shift to\nanother place. On approaching the vicinity of Khaibar, the Prophet ordered his troops\nto halt, and began to invoke his Lord saying: \"O Allâh! Lord of the seven heavens\nand what they harbour beneath, Lord of the seven earths and what lies in their\nwombs, Lord of devils and whomsoever they have led astray; we beseech You to\ngrant us the good of this village (Khaibar), the good of its inhabitants and the good\nthat lies in it. We seek refuge with You from the evil of this village, the evil of its\ninhabitants, and the evil that lies in it.\" Then he ordered, \"Now march (towards the\nvillage) in the Name of Allâh.\" \t[Ibn Hisham 2/329]\n\"The banner\", the Prophet \t[pbuh] \tdeclared \"would be entrusted to a man who loves\nAllâh and His Messenger and they (Allâh and His Messenger) love him.\" All the\nMuslims came forward in the following morning hoping to be granted the honour of\ncarrying the banner. The Prophet [pbuh] called for ‘Ali bin Abi Talib whose eyes used\nto hurt, and handed it to him. ‘Ali, on his part, pledged he would fight the enemies\nuntil they embraced Islam. The Prophet [pbuh] answered him saying: \"Take things\neasy and invite them to accept Islam and brief them on their duties towards Allâh. I\nswear by Allâh that if only one should be guided through your example, that would\nsurely outweigh the best of our camels.\" [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/505, 606]\nKhaibar, it seems, was split into two parts with five forts in the first: Na‘im, As- Sa‘b\nbin Mu‘adh, the castle of Az- Zubair, ’Abi Castle, and An- Nizar in Ash- Shiqq; three\nothers were in part two: Al- Qamus, Al- Wateeh and As- Salalim.\nThe Actual Operation begins\nThe Prophet [pbuh] began the campaign by reducing the minor strongholds one after\nthe other. The first fort he was to attack was Na‘im, the first defence line with a\nformidable strategic position. Marhab, the leader of the fort, invited ‘Amr bin Al-\nAkwa‘ to meet him in combat and the latter responded; when ‘Amr struck the Jew,\nhis sword recoiled and wounded his knee, and he died of that wound. The Prophet\n[pbuh] \tlater said: \"For him (‘Amir) there is a double reward in the Hereafter.\" He\nindicated this by putting two of his fingers together. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib then undertook\nto meet Marhab in combat, and managed to kill him. Yasir, Marhab’s brother, then\nturned up challenging the Muslims to a fight. Az- Zubair was equal to it and killed him\non the spot. Real fighting then broke out and lasted for a few days. The Jews showed\ncourage and proved to be too formidable even to the repeated rushes of the veteran\nsoldiers of Islam. However, they later realized the futility of resistance and began to\nabandon their positions in An- Na‘im and infiltrate into the fortress of As- Sa‘b.\nAl- Hubab bin Al- Mundhir Al- Ansari led the attack on As- Sa‘b fortress and laid siege to\nit for three days after which the Muslims stormed it with a lot of booty, provisions\n\n-- 235 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n236\nand food to fall to their lot therein. This victory came in the wake of the Prophet’s\n[pbuh] invocation to Allâh to help Banu Aslam in their relentless and daring attempts\nto capture that fort.\nDuring the process of the war operations, extreme hunger struck the Muslims. They\nlit fires, slaughtered domestic asses and began to cook them. When the Prophet\n[pbuh] inquired about the fires and cooking, he ordered that they throw away the\nmeat and wash the cooking pots, forbidding the practice of eating such meat.\nThe Jews, meanwhile, evacuated An- Natat and barricaded themselves in Az- Zubair\nfort, a formidable defensive position inaccessible to both cavalry and infantry. The\nMuslims besieged it for three days, but in vain. A Jew spy told the Prophet about a\nsubterranean water source that provided them with water, and advised that it be cut\noff in order to undermine their resistance. The Prophet \t[pbuh] \tdid that so the Jews\ngot out to engage with the Muslims in fierce fighting during which some Muslims and\nten Jews were killed, but the fort was eventually conquered.\nShortly after this battle, the Jews moved to ’Abi Castle and barricaded themselves\ninside. The same events recurred; the Muslims besieged the new site for three days\nand then the great Muslim hero Abu Dujanah Sammak bin Kharshah Al- Ansari — of\nthe red ribbon — led the Muslim army and broke into the castle, conducted fierce\nmilitary operations within and forced the remaining Jews to flee for their lives into\nanother fort, An- Nizar.\nAn- Nizar was the most powerful fort, and the Jews came to the established\nconviction that it was too immune to be stormed, so they deemed it a safe place for\ntheir children and women. The Muslims, however, were not dismayed but dragged on\nthe siege, but because standing at a commanding top, the fort was impregnable. The\nJews inside were too cowardly to meet the Muslims in open fight but rather hurled a\nshower of arrows and stones on the attackers. Considering this situation, the Prophet\n[pbuh] ordered that rams be used and these proved effective and caused cracks in\nthe ramparts providing an easy access into the heart of the fort, where the Jews\nwere put to rout and fled in all directions leaving behind their women and children.\nWith these series of military victories, the first division of Khaibar was totally\nreduced, and the Jews in the other minor fortresses evacuated them and fled to the\nsecond division.\nThe Second Part of Khaibar conquered\nWhen the Prophet [pbuh], along with his army, moved to this part of Khaibar, Al-\nKatiba, he laid a heavy siege to it for fourteen days with the Jews barricading\nthemselves inside their forts. When he was about to use the rams, the Jews realized\nthat they would perish, therefore, they asked for a negotiable peace treaty.\nThere is one controversial point in this context. Was this part of Khaibar (with its\nthree forts) conquered by force? Ibn Ishaq clearly stated that Al- Qamus fort was\nconquered by force. Al- Waqidi, on the other hand, maintained that the three forts\nwere taken through peace negotiations, and force, if any, was resorted to only to\nhand the fort over to the Muslims; the two other forts surrendered without fighting.\n\n-- 236 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n237\nNegotiations\nIbn Abi Al- Huqaiq was despatched to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to negotiate the\nsurrender treaty. The Prophet [pbuh] agreed to spare their lives on condition they\nevacuate Khaibar and the adjacent land, leaving whatever gold and silver they had in\ntheir possession. However, he stipulated that he would disavow any commitment if\nthey concealed anything. Shortly afterwards, the forts were handed over to the\nMuslims and all Khaibar was reduced and brought under the sway of Islam.\nThis treaty notwithstanding, Abi Al- Huqaiq’s two sons concealed a leather bag full of\njewels, and money belonging to Huyai bin Al- Akhtab, who carried it with him when\nBanu Nadir had been banished. Kinanah bin Ar- Rabi‘, who had hidden the musk\nsomewhere, was obdurate in his denial and so he was killed when the musk was\ndiscovered and his dishonesty was proven. Abi Al- Huqaiq’s two sons were killed in\nrecompense for breaching the covenant, and Safiyah, Huyai’s daughter was taken as\na captive.\nDistribution of Spoils\nIn accordance with the agreement already concluded, the Jews would be obliged to\nevacuate Khaibar, but they were anxious to keep on cultivating the rich soil and fine\norchard for which Khaibar was famous. They, therefore, approached the Prophet\n[pbuh] with the request that they be allowed to cultivate their lands and they would\ngive half of the produce to the Muslims. Muhammad [pbuh] was kind enough to\naccede to their request.\nThe Messenger \t[pbuh] \tdivided the land of Khaibar into two: one half to provide the\nfood to be stored in case of any accidental calamity that might befall the Muslims,\nand for entertaining the foreign delegates who started to frequent Madinah a lot; the\nother half would go to the Muslims who had witnessed Al- Hudaibiyah event whether\npresent or absent. The total number of shares came to 36, of which 18 were given to\nthe people above- mentioned. The army consisted of 1400 men of whom were 200\nhorsemen. The horseman was allotted 3 shares and the footman one. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/137,\n138]\nThe spoils taken at Khaibar were so great that Ibn ‘Umar said: \"We never ate our fill\nuntil we had conquered Khaibar.\" ‘Aishah [R] is narrated to have said: \"Now we can\neat our fill of dates.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/609]\nOn their return to Madinah, the Emigrants were able to return to the Helpers of\nMadinah all the gifts they had received. All of this affluence came after the conquest\nof Khaibar and the great economic benefits that the Muslims began to reap. \t[Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 2/148; Sahih Muslim 2/96]\nThe conquest of Khaibar coincided with the arrival of the Prophet’s cousin Ja‘far bin\nAbi Talib and his companions along with Abi Musa Al- Ash‘ari and some Muslims from\nAbyssinia (Ethiopia).\nAbu Musa Al- Ash‘ari narrated that he and over fifty companions, while in Yemen,\ntook a ship which landed them in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and they happened to meet\nthere Ja‘far and his companions. He said, \"We stayed together until the Prophet\n[pbuh] \tsent an envoy asking us to come back. When we returned, we found out\n\n-- 237 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n238\nthat he had already conquered Khaibar, yet he gave us our due shares of the spoils.\"\nThe advent of those men came at the request made by the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), through a Prophetic deputy, ‘Amr bin\nOmaiya Ad- Damari. Negus sent them back, 16 men altogether with their wives and\nchildren on two boats. The rest of emigrants had arrived in Madinah earlier.\n[Muhadarat Tareekh Al- Umam Al- Islamiyah 1/128]\nIn the same context, Safiyah, whose husband Kinanah bin Abi Al- Huqaiq was killed\nfor treachery, was taken as a captive and brought along with other prisoners of war.\nAfter the permission of the Prophet [pbuh] was sought, Dihyah Al- Kalbi chose one of\nthem and she happened to be Safiyah. The other Muslims, however, advised that\nSafiyah, being the daughter of the chief of Bani Quraiza and Bani Nadir, should be\nmarried to the Prophet [pbuh], who agreed to their opinion, invited her to Islam,\nfreed and took her as wife on her embracing Islam. The wedding feast consisted of\ndates and fat, and was held on his way back to Madinah at a spot called Sadd As-\nSahba’.\nAfter the conquest of Khaibar, a Jewish woman called Zainab bint Al- Harith offered\nthe Prophet \t[pbuh] \ta roasted sheep she had poisoned. He took a mouthful, but it\nwas not to his liking so he spat it out. After investigation, the woman confessed that\nshe had stuffed the food with poison alleging that if the eater were a king, she would\nthen rid herself of him, but should he be a Prophet, then he would be bound to learn\nabout it. The Prophet \t[pbuh], however, connived at her treacherous attempt, but\nordered that she be killed when Bishr bin Al- Bara’ died of that poison.\nThe number of Muslims who were martyred was controversial, but it ranged between\n16 and 18, while the number of Jews killed came to 93.\nThe rest of Khaibar also fell to the Muslims. Allâh cast fear into the hearts of the\npeople of Fadak, a village standing to the north of Khaibar, and they hastened to ask\nfor peace, and be allowed to leave in safety, and give up their wealth in return for\nthat. The Prophet \t[pbuh] \tentered into an agreement with them similar to the\nprevious one with the people of Khaibar. Fadak was exclusively the Prophet’s\nbecause neither Muslim cavalry nor camelry were involved in fight thereby.\nNo sooner had the Prophet \t[pbuh] \tdischarged the affair of Khaibar than he started a\nfresh move towards Wadi Al- Qura, another Jewish colony in Arabia. He mobilized his\nforces and divided them into three regiments with four banners entrusted to Sa‘d bin\n‘Ubada, Al- Hubab bin Mundhir, ‘Abbad bin Bishr and Sahl bin Haneef. Prior to\nfighting, he invited the Jews to embrace Islam but all his words and exhortations fell\non deaf ears. Eleven of the Jews were killed one after another and with each one\nnewly killed, a fresh call was extended inviting those people to profess the new faith.\nFighting went on ceaselessly for approximately two days and resulted in full\nsurrender of the Jews. Their land was conquered, and a lot of booty fell in the hands\nof the Muslims.\nThe Prophet \t[pbuh] \tstayed in Wadi Al- Qura for four days, distributed the booty\namong the Muslim fighters and reached an agreement with the Jews similar to that\nof Khaibar. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/146, 147]\nThe Jews of Taima’, hearing beforehand about the successive victories of the Muslim\narmy and the defeats that their brethren, the Jews, had sustained, showed no\n\n-- 238 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n239\nresistance when the Prophet \t[pbuh] \treached their habitation. On the contrary, they\ntook the initiative and offered to sign a reconciliation treaty to the effect that they\nreceive protection but pay tribute in return. Having achieved his objective and\nsubdued the Jews completely, the Prophet \t[pbuh] \tmade his way back home and\narrived in Madinah in late Safar or early Rabi‘ Al- Awwal 7 A.H.\nIt is noteworthy that the Prophet \t[ pbuh], being the best amongst war experts,\nrealized quite readily that evacuating Madinah after the lapse of the prohibited\nmonths (Muharram, Dhul Qa‘da and Dhul Hijja) would not be wise at all with the\npresence of the desert bedouins roaming in its vicinity. Such a careless attitude, the\nProphet [pbuh] believed, would tempt the undisciplined mob to practise their\nfavourite hobby of plundering, looting and all acts of piracy. This premonition always\nin mind, the Prophet \t[pbuh] \tdespatched Aban bin Sa‘id at the head of a platoon to\ndeter those bedouins and forestall any attempt at raiding the headquarters of the\nnascent Islamic state during his absence in Khaibar. Aban achieved his task\nsuccessfully and joined the Prophet \t[pbuh] \tin Khaibar after it had been conquered.\n\n-- 239 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n240\nSporadic Invasions\nThe Expedition called Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ (in the year 7 A.H.)\nHaving subdued two powerful sides of the Confederates coalition, the Prophet [pbuh]\nstarted preparations to discipline the third party, i.e. the desert bedouins, who took\nNajd for habitation, and continued in their usual practices of looting and plundering.\nUnlike the Jews of Khaibar and people of Makkah, they had a liking for living in the\nwilderness dispersed in scattered spots, hence the difficulty of bringing them under\ncontrol, and the futility of carrying out deterrent campaigns against them. However,\nthe Prophet [pbuh] was determined to put an end to this unacceptable situation and\ncalled the Muslims around him to get ready to launch a decisive campaign against\nthose harassing rebels. Meanwhile it was reported to him that Bani Muharib and\nBanu Tha‘lbah of the Ghatfan tribe were gathering army in order to encounter the\nMuslims. The Prophet [pbuh] proceeded towards Najd at the head of 400 or 700\nmen, after he had mandated Abu Dhar - in another version, ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan - to\ndispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The Muslim fighters penetrated\ndeep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhlah where they came across\nsome bedouins of Ghatfan, but no fighting took place because the latter had agreed\nto go into reconciliation with the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] led his followers that\nday in a prayer of fear.\nAl- Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Musa Al- Ash‘ari, narrated that they set out on an\nexpedition with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \"We were six in number and had\n(with us) only one camel which we rode turn by turn. Our feet were injured. My feet\nwere so badly injured that my nails came off. We, therefore, bandaged our feet with\nrags, so this expedition was called \tDhat- ur- Riqa‘ \t(i.e. the expedition of rags.)\" \t[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 2/592; Sahih Muslim 2/118]\nJabir narrated: In the course of \tDhat- ur- Riqa‘ \texpedition, we came to a leafy tree\nwhere the Prophet [pbuh] sat shading himself off the burning sun. The others\ndispersed here and there seeking shelter from heat. The Prophet [pbuh] had a short\nnap after he had hung his sword on the tree. A polytheist, meanwhile came, seized\nthe sword and unsheathed it.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] woke up to find his sword drawn in the man’s hand. The bedouin\nhere asked the Prophet (unarmed then): \"Who would hold me back from killing you\nnow?\" The Prophet [pbuh] then answered: \"It is Allâh.\" In another version, it was\nreported that the Prophet [pbuh] took the sword when it had fallen down and the\nman said: \"You (the Prophet) are the best one to hold a sword.\" The Prophet [pbuh]\nasked the man if he would testify to the Oneness of Allâh and the Messengership of\nMuhammad. The Arabian answered that he would never engage in a fight against\nhim, nor would he ally people fighting the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] set the man\nfree and let him go to his people to say to them that he had seen the best one\namong all people. \t[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.264; Fath Al-Bari 7/416]\nA woman from the Arabians was taken prisoner in the context of this battle. Her\nhusband, on hearing the news, swore he would never stop until he had shed the\nblood of a Muslim. Secretly at night, he approached the camp of the Muslims when\nhe saw two sentries stationed there to alert the Muslims against any emergency. He\nshot the first one, Abbad bin Bishr, who was observing prayer, with an arrow but he\ndid not stop prayer, he simply pulled it out. Then he was shot by three other arrows\n\n-- 240 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n241\nbut would not interrupt his prayer. After he had done the closing salutations, he\nawakened his companion ‘Ammar bin Yasir, who remonstrated that he should have\nalerted him to which the latter replied that he was half way through a Chapter and\ndid not like to interrupt it. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112; Ibn Hisham 2/203-209]\nThe victory at the expedition of \tDhat- ur- Riqa‘ \thad a tremendous impact on all the\nArabians. It cast fear into their hearts and rendered them too powerless to\nantagonize the Muslim society in Madinah. They began to acquiesce in the prevailing\nsituation and resigned themselves to new geo- political conditions working in favour\nof the new religion. Some of them even embraced Islam and took an active part in\nthe conquest of Makkah and the battle of Hunain, and received their due shares of\nthe war booty.\nFrom that time onward, the anti- Islam tripartite coalition had been subdued, and\npeace and security prevailed. The Muslims, then started to redress any political\nimbalance and fill in the small gaps that still triggered unrest here and there in the\nface of the great drive of Islamization that enveloped the whole area. We could in\nthis context mention some of these incidental skirmishes which pointed markedly to\nthe ever- growing power of the Muslim society.\n1. \tA platoon headed by Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah Al- Laithi in Safar or in Rabi‘ Al-\nAwwal 7 A.H. was despatched to muffle the provocative behaviour of Bani Al-\nMuluh. The Muslims managed to kill a large number of the enemy soldiers and\ncaptured a great deal of booty. A large army of polytheists rushed in their\nheel but floods hindered the pursuit, and the Muslims managed to withdraw in\nsafety.\n2. \t‘Umar bin Al- Khattab, at the head of a 30- soldier group, set out to a spot\ncalled Turbah in Sha‘ban 7 A.H. to discipline the people of Hawazin. He no\nlonger arrived at their habitation that they fled for their lives.\n3. \tThirty men with Basheer bin Sa‘d Al- Ansari headed for Bani Murrah in Sha‘ban\n7 A.H. in Fadak area. He killed a large number of the enemy and seized a lot\nof their camels and cattle. On his way back, the enemy gathered up forces\nand overtook the Muslims at night. They showered Basheer and his men with\narrows, and killed all the Muslims except Basheer, who took refuge in Fadak\nand stayed with the Jews there until his wounds healed.\n4. \tGhalib bin ‘Abdullah Al- Laithi at the head of a platoon of 130 men launched an\nattack against Bani ‘Awâl and Bani ‘Abd bin Tha‘lbah in Ramadan 7 A.H. They\nkilled some of the enemy’s men and captured their cattle and camels. ‘Usama\nbin Zaid killed Mardas bin Nahik, a polytheist, but after he had pronounced\nthe testimony of Allâh’s Oneness to which incident the Prophet [pbuh]\ncommented addressing his Companions: \"Would you rip open his heart to\ndiscern whether he is truthful or a liar?\"\n5. \tA thirty- horseman group headed by ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha marched towards\nKhaibar on reports that Aseer (or Basheer bin Razam) was rallying the ranks\nof Bani Ghatfan to attack the Muslims: They managed to persuade that Jew to\nfollow them to Madinah encouraging him that the Prophet [pbuh] would\ninstitute him as a ruler of Khaibar. On their way back there occurred a sort of\nmisunderstanding that gave rise to fierce fighting between the two parties\nresulting in the death of Aseer and the thirty men with him.\n6. \tIn Shawwal 7 A.H., Basheer bin Sa‘d Al- Ansari marched towards Yemen and\nJabar at the head of 300 Muslim fighters to subdue a large mob of polytheists\n\n-- 241 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n242\nwho gathered to raid the outskirts of Madinah. Basheer and his men used to\nmarch at night and lurk during the day until they reached their destination.\nHaving heard about the advent of the Muslims, the polytheists fled away\nleaving behind them a large booty and two men who later embraced Islam on\narrival in Madinah.\n7. \tIn the year 7 A.H., shortly before the Compensatory \t‘Umrah \t(lesser\npilgrimage), a man called Jashm bin Mu‘awiyah came to a spot called Ghabah\nwhere he wanted to gather the people of Qais and entice them into fighting\nthe Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh], on hearing these reports, despatched Abu\nHadrad with two men to see to the situation. Abu Hadrad, through a clever\nstrategy, managed to rout the enemy and capture a lot of their cattle. \t[Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 2/149, 150; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/229, 230; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.322-324]\n\n-- 242 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n243\nThe Compensatory ‘Umrah\n(Lesser Pilgrimage)\nWhen Dhul Qa‘da month approached towards the close of the seventh year A.H., the\nProphet [pbuh] ordered his people, and the men who witnessed Al- Hudaibiyah Truce\nTreaty in particular, to make preparations to perform \t‘Umrah \t(lesser pilgrimage). He\nproceeded with 2000 men besides some women and children [Fath Al- Bari 7/700],\nand 60 camels for sacrifice, to visit the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah. The Muslims took\ntheir weapons with them fearing the treachery of the Quraishites, but left them with\na party of two hundred men at a place some eight miles from Makkah. They entered\nthe city with the swords in their scabbards [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/151; Fath Al- Bari\n7/700], with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head on his she- camel, Al- Qaswa’, while the\nsurrounding Companions attentively focusing their look on him, all saying: \"Here I\nam! at Your service O Allâh!\" The Quraishites had left the place and retired to their\ntents on the adjoining hills. The Muslims performed the usual circumambulation\nvigorously and briskly; and on recommendation by the Prophet [pbuh] they did their\nbest to appear strong and steadfast in their circumambulation as the polytheists had\nspread rumours that they were weak because the fever of Yathrib (Madinah) had\nsapped their strength. They were ordered to run in the first three rounds and then\nwalk in the remaining ones. The Makkans meanwhile aligned on the top of Qu‘aiqa‘an\nMount watching the Muslims, tongue- tied at witnessing their strength and devotion.\nWhen they entered the Holy Sanctuary, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha walked before the\nProphet [pbuh] reciting:\n\"Get out of his way, you disbelievers, make way, we will fight you about its\nrevelation with strokes that will remove heads from shoulders and make friend\nunmindful of friend.\"\nAfter ritual walking and running between the two hills of Makkah, Safa and Marwah,\nthe Prophet[pbuh] with the Muslims halted at the latter spot to slaughter the\nsacrificial animals and shave their heads.\nThe main body of the pilgrims had now performed the basic rites of the lesser\npilgrimage, but there remained those who were entrusted the charge of the\nweapons. The Prophet had these relieved, and they went through the same\ndevotions as the others did.\nOn the morning of the fourth day of the pilgrimage, the notables of Quraish asked\n‘Ali bin Abi Talib to tell the Prophet [pbuh] to leave Makkah along with his\nCompanions. He, of course, could not conceive of violating the terms of Al-\nHudaibiyah Treaty, therefore he ordered his men to depart for a village called Sarif\nwhere he stayed for some time.\nIt was during this visit of the Prophet [pbuh] to Makkah for pilgrimage that his uncle\n‘Abbas offered the hand of his sister- in- law, Maimuna — the daughter of Harith, to\nhim. The Prophet [pbuh] was kind enough to accept this offer since it was an\neffective step towards cementing the ties of relationship between the Prophet [pbuh]\nand the influential men of Makkah. The wedding took place in Sarif. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/152]\n\n-- 243 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n244\nNarrators attached different designations to this lesser pilgrimage. Some called it the\ncompensatory lesser pilgrimage, performed instead of that uncompleted of\nHudaibiyah; and the other one, given preponderance by jurists, is the lesser\npilgrimage consequent on certain terms of a treaty already agreed upon.\nOn the whole, compensatory, judicial consent, retribution and reconciliation are all\nterms applicable to that visit.\nSome military operations, directed against some still obdurate desert Arabians, took\nplace at the conclusion of the lesser pilgrimage, of which we could mention:\n1. \tA platoon of 50 men led by Ibn Abi Al- ‘Awja’ was despatched by the Prophet\n[pbuh] to the habitations of Bani Saleem inviting them to embrace Islam, but\nall the words fell on deaf ears. Fierce fighting erupted between both parties\nduring which the Muslim leader was wounded, and two of the enemy were\ncaptured.\n2. \tGhalib bin ‘Abdullah at the head of 200 men was despatched to Fadak where\nthey killed some rebels and a lot of booty fell to their lot.\n3. \tBanu Quda‘a had gathered a large number of men to raid the Muslim\npositions. On hearing the news, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Ka‘b bin\n‘Umair Al- Ansari at the head of 15 men to deal with this situation. They\nencountered the army, and called them to enter into the fold of Islam but the\nrebels gave a negative response and showered the Muslims with arrows killing\nall of them except one who was carried back home later seriously wounded.\n[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/231]\nThere was also an insignificant skirmish that occurred in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal 8 A.H. Shuja‘\nbin Wahab Al- Asadi, along with 25 men, marched towards Bani Hawazin tribe where\nthey encountered no resistance but managed to gain some booty. \t[Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al-\nAthar p.33; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/231]\n\n-- 244 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n245\nThe Battle of Mu’tah\nIt was the most significant and the fiercest battle during the lifetime of the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], a preliminary and a prelude to the great conquests of the\nland of the Christians. It took place in Jumada Al- Ula 8 A.H. / September 629 A.D.\nMu’tah is a village that lies on the borders of geographical Syria.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had sent Al- Harith bin ‘Umair Al- Azdi on an errand to carry a\nletter to the ruler of Busra. On his way, he was intercepted by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr\nAl- Ghassani, the governor of Al- Balqa’ and a close ally to Caesar, the Byzantine\nEmperor. Al- Harith was tied and beheaded by Al- Ghassani.\nKilling envoys and messengers used to be regarded as the most awful crime, and\namounted to the degree of war declaration. The Prophet [pbuh] was shocked on\nhearing the news and ordered that a large army of 3000 men be mobilized and\ndespatched to the north to discipline the transgressors. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/155; Fath\nAl- Bari 7/511] It was the largest Muslim army never mobilized on this scale except in\nthe process of the Confederates Battle.\nZaid bin Haritha was appointed to lead the army. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib would replace\nhim if he was killed, and ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha would succeed Ja‘far in case the latter\nfell. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/611] \tA white banner was raised and handed over to Zaid. \t[Mukhtasar Seerat\nAr-Rasool p.327]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] recommended that they reach the scene of Al- Harith’s murder\nand invite the people to profess Islam. Should the latter respond positively, then no\nwar would ensue, otherwise fighting them would be the only alternative left.\nHe ordered them:\n\"Fight the disbelievers in the Name of Allâh, neither breach a covenant nor\nentertain treachery, and under no circumstances a new- born, woman, an\nageing man or a hermit should be killed; moreover neither trees should be\ncut down nor homes demolished. \t[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar- Rasool p.327; Rahmat-\nul- lil'alameen 2/271]\"\nAt the conclusion of the military preparations, the people of Madinah gathered and\nbade the army farewell. ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha began to weep at that moment, and\nwhen asked why he was weeping, he swore that it was not love for this world nor\nunder a motive of infatuation with the glamour of life but rather the Words of Allâh\nspeaking of Fire that he heard the Prophet [pbuh] reciting:\n\"There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a\nDecree which must be accomplished.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 19:71]\nThe Muslim army then marched northward to Ma‘ân, a town bordering on\ngeographical Syria. There news came to the effect that Heraclius had mobilized a\nhundred thousand troops together with another hundred thousand men of ",
  "Lakham,\nJudham and Balqain — Arabian tribes allied to the Byzantines. The Muslims, on their\npart had never thought of encountering such a huge army. They were at a loss about\nwhat course to follow, and spent two nights debating these unfavourable conditions.\n\n-- 245 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n246\nSome suggested that they should write a letter to the Prophet [pbuh] seeking his\nadvice. ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha was opposed to them being reluctant and addressed\nthe Muslims saying: \"I swear by Allâh that this very object which you hold in\nabhorrence is the very one you have set out seeking, martyrdom. In our fight we\ndon’t count on number of soldiers or equipment but rather on the Faith that Allâh has\nhonoured us with. Dart to win either of the two, victory or martyrdom.\" In the light\nof these words, they moved to engage with the enemy in Masharif, a town of Al-\nBalqa’, and then changed direction towards Mu’tah where they encamped. The right\nflank was led by Qutba bin Qatadah Al- ‘Udhari, and the left by ‘Ubadah bin Malik Al-\nAnsari. Bitter fighting started between the two parties, three thousand Muslims\nagainst an enemy fiftyfold as large.\nZaid bin Haritha, the closest to the Messenger’s heart, assumed leadership and\nbegan to fight tenaciously and in matchless spirit of bravery until he fell, fatally\nstabbed. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib then took the banner and did a miraculous job. In the\nthick of the battle, he dismounted, hamstrung his horse and resumed fighting until\nhis right hand was cut off. He seized the banner with his left hand until this too was\ngone. He then clasped the banner with both arms until a Byzantine soldier struck and\ncut him into two parts. he was posthumously called \"the flying Ja‘far\" or \"Ja‘far with\ntwo wings\" because Allâh has awarded him two wings to fly wherever he desired\nthere in the eternal Garden. Al- Bukhari reported fifty stabs in his body, none of them\nin the back. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/611]\n‘Abdullah bin Rawaha then proceeded to hold up the banner and fight bravely on his\nhorseback while reciting enthusiastic verses until he too was killed. Thereupon a\nman, from Bani ‘Ajlan, called Thabit bin Al- Arqam took the banner and called upon\nthe Muslims to choose a leader. The honour was unanimously granted to Khalid bin\nAl- Waleed, a skilled brave fighter and an outstanding strategist. It was reported by\nAl- Bukhari that he used nine swords that broke while he was relentlessly and\ncourageously fighting the enemies of Islam. He, however, realizing the grave\nsituation the Muslims were in, began to follow a different course of encounter,\nrevealing the super strategy- maker, that Khalid was rightly called. He reshuffled the\nright and left flanks of the Muslim army and introduced forward a division from the\nrear in order to cast fear into the hearts of the Byzantine by deluding them that fresh\nreinforcements had arrived. The Muslims engaged with the enemies in sporadic\nskirmishes but gradually and judiciously retreating in a fully organized and well-\nplanned withdrawal.\nThe Byzantines, seeing this new strategy, believed that they were being entrapped\nand drawn in the heart of the desert. They stopped the pursuit, and consequently the\nMuslims managed to retreat back to Madinah with the slightest losses. \t[Fath-Al-Bari 7/513,\n514; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/156]\nThe Muslims sustained twelve martyrs, whereas the number of casualties among the\nByzantines was unknown although the details of the battle point clearly to a large\nnumber. Even though the battle did not satisfy the Muslims’ objective, namely\navenging Al- Harith’s murder, it resulted in a far- ranging impact and attached to the\nMuslims a great reputation in the battlefields. The Byzantine Empire, at that time,\nwas a power to be reckoned with, and mere thinking of antagonizing it used to mean\nself- annihilation, let alone a three- thousand- soldier army going into fight against\n200,000 soldiers far better equipped and lavishly furnished with all luxurious\nconveniences. The battle was a real miracle proving that the Muslims were\nsomething exceptional not then familiar. Moreover, it gave evidence that Allâh\n\n-- 246 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n247\nbacked them and their Prophet, Muhammad, was really Allâh’s Messenger. In the\nlight of these new strategic changes, the archenemies among the desert bedouins\nbegan to reconcile themselves with the new uprising faith and several recalcitrant\ntribes like Banu Saleem, Ashja‘, Ghatfan, Dhubyan, Fazarah and others came to\nprofess Islam out of their own sweet free will.\nMu’tah Battle, after all, constituted the forerunner of the blood encounter to take\nplace with the Byzantines subsequently. It pointed markedly to a new epoch of the\nIslamic conquest of the Byzantine empire and other remote countries, to follow at a\nlater stage.\nDhat As-Salasil Campaign\nDhat As- Salasil \tis a spot situated ten days’ walk north of Madinah. The Muslims are\nsaid to have encamped in a place with a well of water called Salsal, hence the\nterminology \tDhat As- Salasil. \tIn view of the alliance between the Arabian tribes on\nthe borders of Syria and the Byzantines, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it of top\nurgency to carry out a wisely- planned manoeuvre that might bring about a state of\nrapport with those bedouins, and would at the same time detach them from the\nByzantines. For the implementation of this plan, he chose ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As, whose\npaternal grandmother came from Bali, a tribe dwelling in that area. This motive in\nmind, combined with provocative military movements, by Bani Quda‘a, precipitated\nthis preemptive strike which started in Jumada Ath- Thaniya, 8 A.H.\n‘Amr bin Al- ‘As was awarded a white flag with a black banner to go with it. He set\nout at the head of 300 Emigrants and Helpers assisted by a cavalry of 30 men, and\nwas recommended to seek help from Bali, ‘Udhra and Balqain tribes. He used to\nmarch at night and lurk during the day. On approaching the enemy lines and\nrealizing the large build up of men, he sent for reinforcements from Madinah, and\nthese arrived on the spot headed by Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah leading further 200\nmen as well as other platoons including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab. All of\nthem were given strict orders to cooperate, work in harmony and never leave any\narea for disagreement.\nAt noon, Abu ‘Ubaidah wanted to lead the Muslims in prayer, but ‘Amr objected on\ngrounds that the former came only to assist, and leadership in prayer was given to\n‘Amr.\nThe Muslim army reached the habitations of Quda‘a and penetrated deep in their\nland, destroyed the enemies and obliged the others to flee for their lives in different\ndirections.\nAt the conclusion of the military operations, a courier was despatched to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] to brief him on the developments of events and the\nultimate victory achieved.\nKhadrah Campaign\nIn Sha‘ban month 8 A.H., news reached the Prophet [pbuh] of amassing troops by\nBani Ghatfan, still outside the domain of Islam. He urgently summoned Abu Qatadah\nand sent him at the head of fifteen men to discipline those outlaws.\n\n-- 247 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n248\nIt took fifteen days to teach them an unforgettable lesson. Some were killed, others\ncaptured and all their property confiscated. \t[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/233; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al-Athar\np.33]\n\n-- 248 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n249\nThe Conquest of Makkah\nIbn Al- Qaiyim described the conquest of Makkah as the greatest one by which Allâh\nhonoured His religion, Messenger, soldiers and honest party. He thereby rescued the\nSacred House, whose guidance all people seek. It was the greatest propitious event\nin heaven and on earth. It was the most significant prelude to a new era that was to\nwitness the great march of Islamization and the entry of people into the fold of Islam\nin huge hosts. It provided an ever shining face and a most glowing source of\ninspiration to the whole earth. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/160]\nPre-Conquest Events\nAccording to the terms of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Arab tribes were given the\noption to join either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraish, with which they desired\nto enter into treaty alliance. Should any of these tribes suffer aggression, then the\nparty to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu\nBakr joined Quraish, and Khuza‘ah joined the Prophet [pbuh]. They thus lived in\npeace for sometime but ulterior motives stretching back to pre- Islamic period ignited\nby unabated fire of revenge triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without caring a\nbit for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza‘ah in a place called Al-\nWateer in Sha‘ban, 8 A.H. Quraish helped Banu Bakr with men and arms taking\nadvantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah\nsought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary\nto all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chasing them in the\nsanctified area — where no blood should be shed — massacred his adversaries.\nWhen the aggrieved party sought justice from their Muslim allies, the Prophet\n[pbuh], as their leader, demanded an immediate redress for not only violating the\ntreaty but also slaying men allied to him in the sanctified area. Three demands were\nmade, the acceptance of any one of them was imperative:\na. \tto pay blood money for the victims of Khuza‘ah,\nb. \tto terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr; or\nc. \tto consider the truce to have been nullified.\nThis behaviour on the part of Quraish was clearly a breach of the treaty of Al-\nHudaibiyah and was obviously an act of hostility against the allies of the Muslims, i.e.\nBanu Khuza‘ah. Quraish immediately realized the grave situation and feared the\nhorrible consequences looming on the horizon. They immediately called for an\nemergency meeting and decided to delegate their chief Abu Sufyan to Madinah for a\nrenewal of the truce. He directly headed for the house of his daughter Umm Habiba\n(the Prophet’s wife). But as he went to sit on the Messenger’s carpet, she folded it\nup. \"My daughter,\" said he, \"I hardly knew if you think the carpet is too good for me\nor that I am too good for the carpet.\" She replied, \"It is the Messenger of Allâh’s\ncarpet, and you are an unclean polytheist.\"\nBeing disgusted at the curt reply of his daughter, Abu Sufyan stepped out of her\nroom and went to see the Prophet [pbuh], but the latter was well aware of his tricks\nand did not hold him any assurance. He then approached Abu Bakr, but the latter too\ndeclined to interfere. He contacted ‘Umar to intercede but this great Companion\nmade a point- blank refusal. At last he saw ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and began begging him\n\n-- 249 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n250\nin the most humble words, cunningly alluding to the prospects of mastery over all\nthe Arabs if he were to intercede for the renewal of the treaty. ‘Ali also briefly\nregretted his inability to do anything for him.\nAbu Sufyan turned his steps back to Makkah in a state of bitter disappointment and\nutter horror. There he submitted a report of his meeting with his daughter, Abu Bakr,\n‘Umar and ‘Ali’s reaction and the meaningful silence of the Prophet. The Makkans\nwere dismayed, but did not expect imminent danger.\nPreparations for the Attack on Makkah, and the Prophet’s Attempt at imposing a\nNews Black-out\nOn the authority of At- Tabari, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked ‘Aishah [R], his\nspouse three days prior to receiving news relating to breaching of covenant, to make\npreparations peculiar to marching out for war. Abu Bakr, meanwhile, came in and\nasked ‘Aishah [R] what the matter was, showing surprise at the preparations being\nmade as it was not, as he said, the usual time for war. She replied that she had no\nidea. On the morning of the third day ‘Amr bin Sâlim Al- Khuza‘i arrived in the\ncompany of forty horsemen to brief the Prophet [pbuh] on the plight of his people\nand seeking the Muslims’ help for retaliation. People of Madinah then got to know\nthat Quraish had breached the covenant. Budail followed ‘Amr, and then Abu Sufyan\nand the news was unequivocally confirmed.\nWith view of securing a complete news black- out concerning his military intentions,\nthe Prophet [pbuh] despatched an eight- men platoon under the leadership of\nQatadah bin Rab‘i in the direction of Edam, a short distance from Madinah, in\nRamadan 8 A.H., in order to divert the attention of people and screen off the main\ntarget with which he was preoccupied.\nThere was so much dread and fear everywhere that Hatib, one of the most trusted\nfollowers of the Prophet [pbuh] secretly despatched a female messenger with a letter\nto Makkah containing intimation of the intended attack. The Prophet [pbuh] received\nnews from the heaven of Hatib’s action and sent ‘Ali and Al- Miqdad with instructions\nto go after her. They overtook the messenger, and after a long search discovered the\nletter carefully hidden in her locks. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned Hatib and asked\nhim what had induced him to this act. He replied, \"O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]! I\nhave no affinity of blood with Quraish; there is only a kind of friendly relationship\nbetween them and myself. My family is at Makkah and there is no one to look after it\nor to offer protection to it. My position stands in striking contrast to that of the\nrefugees whose families are secure due to their blood ties with Quraish. I felt that\nsince I am not related to them, I should, for the safety of my children, earn their\ngratitude by doing good to them. I swear by Allâh that I have not done this act as an\napostate, forsaking Islam. I was prompted only by the considerations I have just\nexplained.\"\n‘Umar wanted to cut his head off as a hypocrite, but the Prophet [pbuh] accepted his\nexcuse and granted him pardon, then addressed ‘Umar saying: \"Hatib is one of those\nwho fought in the battle of Badr. How do you know that he is a hypocrite? Allâh is\nlikely to look favourably on those who participated in that battle. Turning then, to\nHatib, he said: \"Do as you please, for I have forgiven you.\"\n\n-- 250 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n251\nAfter making full preparation, the Prophet [pbuh] proceeded to Makkah at the head\nof ten thousand soldiers on the 10th of Ramadan, 8 A.H. He mandated Abu Ruhm Al-\nGhifari to dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. When they reached Al-\nJuhfa, Al- ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and his family came to join the Prophet [pbuh].\nAt Al- Abwa’, the Muslims came across Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith and ‘Abdullah bin\nOmaiyah, the Prophet’s cousins, but, on account of the harm they had inflicted, and\ntheir satiric language, on the believers, they were not welcomed. ‘Ali addressed Abu\nSufyan to go and beseech the Prophet [pbuh] for pardon and confess his ill-\nbehaviour in a manner similar to that of Yusuf’s (the Prophet Joseph) brothers:\n\"They said: ‘By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we\ncertainly have been sinners.’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 12:91]\nAbu Sufyan observed ‘Ali’s counsel, to which the Prophet quoted Allâh’s Words:\n\"He said: ‘No reproach on you this day, may Allâh forgive you, and He is the\nMost Merciful of those who show mercy!’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 12:92]\nAbu Sufyan recited some verses paying a generous tribute to the Prophet [pbuh] and\nprofessing Islam as his only religion.\nThe Muslims then marched on in a state of fasting until they reached a place called\nAl- Qadeed where water was available. There they broke fast [Sahih Al- Bukhari\n2/613] and resumed their movement towards Mar Az- Zahran. The Quraishites were\nquite unaware of the development of affairs, but the Prophet [pbuh] did not like to\ntake them by surprise. He, therefore, ordered his men to kindle fire on all sides for\ncooking purposes. The idea behind this was that Quraish should be afforded full\nopportunity to assess the situation in which they were pitchforked correctly, and\nshould not endanger their lives by leaping blindly in the battlefield. ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab was entrusted with the guard duty. In the meanwhile, Abu Sufyan along\nwith Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqua’, two terrible polytheists, went out to\nreconnoiter. Before they got near the camp, they met ‘Abbas, the Prophet’s uncle.\nHe apprised Abu Sufyan of the situation and advised him to accept Islam and\npersuade his people to surrender before Muhammad [pbuh]; otherwise, his head\nwould be struck off.\nUnder the prevailing compelling circumstances, Abu Sufyan went in the company of\n‘Abbas seeking the Prophet’s [pbuh] audience. The Muslims were furious to see Abu\nSufyan and wanted to kill him on the spot. But the two men managed, not without\ndifficulties, to see the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who advised that they see him the\nfollowing day. The Prophet [pbuh] addressed Abu Sufyan saying: \"Woe to you! Isn’t\nit time for you to bear witness to the Oneness of Allâh and Prophethood of\nMuhammad?\" Here, the archenemy of Islam began to beseech the Prophet [pbuh] in\nthe most earnest words that testify to the Prophet’s generosity and mild temper\nbegging for pardon and forgiveness, and professing wholeheartedly the new faith.\nOn request by ‘Abbas, the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of the general amnesty he\nproclaimed, gave Abu Sufyan, who had a liking for bragging, a special privilege,\nsaying: \"He who takes refuge in Abu Sufyan’s house is safe; whosoever confines\nhimself to his house, the inmates thereof shall be in safety, and he who enters the\nSacred Mosque is safe.\"\n\n-- 251 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n252\nOn the morning of Tuesday, 17th. Ramadan, 8 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] left Mar Az-\nZahran. He ordered Al- ‘Abbas to detain Abu Sufyan at a commanding gorge that\ncould afford a full view of the Muslim army parading on its way towards Makkah, and\nhence give him the chance to see the great and powerful soldiers of Allâh. The\ndifferent tribes successively passed with their banners flown up, until at last the\nbattalion of the Emigrants and Helpers with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head heavily\narmed marched by. Abu Sufyan began to wonder who those people were, to which\nAl- ‘Abbas told him that they were Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions. Abu\nSufyan said that no army however powerful could resist those people and addressing\nAl- ‘Abbas, he said: \"I swear by Allâh that the sovereignty of your brother’s son has\nbecome too powerful to withstand.\" Al- ‘Abbas answered, \"It is rather the power of\nProphethood,\" to which the former agreed.\nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah carried the flag of the Helpers. When he passed by Abu Sufyan, he\nsaid \"Today will witness the great fight, you cannot seek sanctuary at Al- Ka‘bah.\nToday will witness the humiliation of Quraish.\" Abu Sufyan complained about this to\nt he Prophet [pbuh] who got angry and said \"Nay, today Al- Ka‘bah will be sanctified,\nand Quraish honoured,\" and quickly ordered that Sa‘d should be stripped off the flag,\nand that it should be entrusted to his son Qais, in another version, to Az- Zubair.\nAl- ‘Abbas urged Abu Sufyan to hasten into Makkah and warn the Quraishites against\nany aggressive behaviour towards the Muslims. There in Makkah, he shouted at the\ntop of his voice and warned against any hostilities advising them to seek safety in his\nhouse. His wife got indignant and tugged at his moustache cursing him and abusing\nhis cowardly stance. The people within Makkah mocked Abu Sufyan and dispersed in\ndifferent directions, some into their houses, others into the Holy Sanctuary while\nsome undisciplined reckless ruffians led by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin\nOmaiyah and Suhail bin ‘Amr encamped themselves in a place called Khandamah,\nwith a murderous intent in their minds.\nThe Prophet [pbuh], on his part, was quite modestly and calmly drawing the final\ntouches for the military breakthrough awaiting the Muslims, by Allâh’s Will. He\nappointed Khalid bin Al- Waleed as a leader of the right flank of the army with Aslam,\nSulaim, Ghifar, Muzainah and Juhainah tribes under his command to enter Makkah\nthrough its lower avenues. Az- Zubair bin ‘Awwam was to lead the left flank and\nwould storm Makkah from the upper side holding up the Messenger’s banner. Abu\n‘Ubaidah took command of the infantry and was to penetrate into the city via a side\nvalley. They were given full and decisive orders not to kill unless in self defence and\nin that case they would exterminate any aggressive elements and quell any\nopposition.\nThe Muslim battalions marched out each in its already drawn route to fulfill the\nmissions they were supposed to carry out. Khalid bin Al- Waleed worked his way into\nthe heart of the town quite successively killing twelve of the ruffians and sustaining\ntwo martyrs. Az- Zubair set out and reached the fixed destination where he planted\nthe banner at Al- Fath (conquest) Mosque and waited there for the arrival of the\nProphet [pbuh]. A tent was pitched for him where he offered prayers of thanks to the\nAll- Mighty Allâh, Who, out of His immense grace, had granted him a splendid victory.\nBut he did not repose long. He, in the company of the Helpers and Emigrants, got up\nand proceeded towards Al- Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, which is an emblem of the\nOneness and Supremacy of Allâh. It was unfortunately infested with idols that\n\n-- 252 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n253\nnumbered 360. He knocked them down with his bow while reciting the verse of the\nNoble Qur’ân:\n\"And Say: ‘Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur’ân or \tJihâd \tagainst\npolytheists) has come and \tBatil \t(falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism, etc.)\nhas vanished. Surely! \tBatil \tis ever bound to vanish.’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 17:81]\nAnd Allâh further said:\n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): \"The Truth (the Qur’ân and Allah’s\nInspiration) has come, and \tAl- Batil \t(falsehood - \tIblis) can neither create\nanything nor resurrect (any thing).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 34:49]\nHe then started the usual circumambulation on his ride. He was not in a state of\nIhram \t(ritual consecration) then. On completion, he called for ‘Uthman bin Talhah,\nthe janitor of \tAl- Ka‘bah, from whom he took the key. He went in and saw images of\nProphets Ibrahim and Ishmael, [AWS], throwing divination arrows. He denounced\nthese acts of Quraish and ordered that all idols be dismantled, images and effigies\ndeleted. He then entered the sacred hall to face the wall opposite the door and there\nagain performed devout prostrations, and went around acclaiming Allâh’s Greatness\nand Oneness. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the door- way and standing upon its\nelevated step, gazed in thankfulness on the thronging multitude below and delivered\nthe following celebrated address:\n\"There is no god but Allâh Alone. He has no associates. He made good His Promise\nthat He held to His slave and helped him and defeated all the Confederates along.\nBear in mind that every claim of privilege, whether that of blood, or property, is\nunder my heel, except that of the custody of \tAl- Ka‘bah \tand supplying of water to the\npilgrims. Bear in mind that for anyone who is slain, even though semi- deliberately,\nwith club or whip, for him the blood- money is very severe: a hundred camels, forty\nof them to be pregnant.\n\"O people of Quraish! surely Allâh has abolished from you all pride of the\npre- Islamic era and all conceit in your ancestry, (because) all men are\ndescended from Adam, and Adam was made out of clay.\"\nHe then recited to them the verse:\n\"O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you\ninto nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most\nhonourable of you near Allâh is that (believer) who has \tAt- Taqwa \t[i.e. one\nof the \tMuttaqûn: i.e. pious and righteous persons who fear Allâh much\n(abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and\nlove Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].\nVerily, Allâh is All- Knowing, All- Aware.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 49:13]\nHe further added:\n\"O you people of Quraish! What do you think of the treatment that I am\nabout to accord to you?\"\n\n-- 253 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n254\nThey replied:\n\"O noble brother and son of noble brother! We expect nothing but goodness\nfrom you.\"\nUpon this he said:\n\"I speak to you in the same words as Yusuf (the Prophet Joseph) spoke\nunto his brothers: He said: \"No reproach on you this day,\" \t[Al- Qur'an 12:92]\ngo your way, for you are freed ones.\"\nAs for the door- keeping of Al- Ka‘bah and supplying of water to pilgrims, the Prophet\n[pbuh] ordered that these jobs remain in the hand of ‘Uthman bin Talhah and that\nthe key will stay with him and his descendants for ever.\nWhen time for prayer approached, Bilal ascended Al- Ka‘bah and called for prayer.\nAbu Sufyan bin Harb, ‘Itab bin Usaid and Al- Harith bin Hisham were meanwhile\nsitting in the yard. ‘Itab bin Usaid commented on the new situation (Bilal ascending\nAl- Ka‘bah and calling for prayer) saying that Allâh honoured Usaid (his father) having\nnot heard such words. The Prophet [pbuh] approached and assisted by Divine\nRevelation told them that he had learnt about what they had spoken of. Al- Harith\nand ‘Itab, taken by incredible surprise, immediately professed Islam and bore\nwitness to the Messengership of Muhammad [pbuh] adding that \"We swear by Allâh\nthat none had been with us to inform you.\"\nOn that very day, the Prophet [pbuh] entered ‘Umm Hani’s house where he washed\nand offered prayers of victory. ‘Umm Hani had sheltered two Makkan relatives of\nhers in her house in which act she was granted support by the Prophet [pbuh].\nShedding blood of nine arch- criminals was declared lawful even under the curtains of\nAl- Ka‘bah. Nevertheless, only four of them were killed while the others were\npardoned for different reasons. As for those who were killed, mention could be made\nof ‘Abdul ‘Uzza bin Khatal who had become a Muslim and then deputed to collect\nalms- tax in the company of a Helper. They had also a slave with them. ‘Abdullah, in\na fit of rage, killed the Helper’s slave on account of a mere trifling dispute, and\njoined the pagan Arabs as an apostate. He was never repentant at this heinous crime\nbut rather employed two women singers and incited them to sing satirically about\nthe Prophet [pbuh].\nThe other man who was put to death was Miqyas bin Sababa. He was a Muslim. A\nHelper accidently killed his brother Hisham. The Prophet [pbuh] had arranged the\npayment of blood money to him, which he had accepted. His revengeful nature,\nhowever, was never appeased, so he killed the Helper and went to Makkah as an\napostate.\nSimilarly, Huwairith and one woman singer went to death.\nOn the other hand, every attempt was made to grant pardon to the people. ‘Ikrimah\nbin Abu Jahl, who had attacked Khalid’s detachment at the time of the entry into\nMakkah, was forgiven. To Wahshi, the murderer of Hamzah, the Prophet’s uncle, and\nto Hind, who had chewed his liver, was also extended his generous clemency. The\n\n-- 254 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n255\nsame generous treatment was accorded to Habar who had attacked the Prophet’s\ndaughter with a spear, while on her way from Makkah to Madinah, so grievously that\nshe ultimately died of the fatal injuries.\nIn the same context of magnanimity peculiar to Muhammad [pbuh], two chiefs of\nQuraish were pardoned once they had embraced Islam. They were Safwan bin\nOmaiyah and Fudalah bin ‘Umair. The latter had attempted to assassinate the\nProphet [pbuh] while circumambulating in the Holy Sanctuary. The Prophet’s\nmatchless tolerance and broad- mindedness instigated by his mission as ‘A mercy to\nall people’, converted a terrible hypocrite into a faithful devout believer.\nOn the second day of the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] stood up and\naddressed the people in matters relating to the holy status of Makkah. After\nentertaining Allâh’s praise, he proclaimed that Makkah was a holy land and would\nremain so till the Day of Judgement. No bloodshed was allowed therein. Should\nanyone take the liberty of fighting within Makkah on grounds derived from the\nevents that characterized the conquest, he should remember that it had been a\nlicence granted temporarily to the Prophet, and virtually does not go for others. Ibn\n‘Abbas [R] narrated: The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Allâh has made Makkah, a sanctuary,\nso it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was\nmade legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not\nallowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or\nto pick up its fallen things except by a person who would announce that (what has\nfound) publicly.\" Al- ‘Abbas said: \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Except the lemon grass (for it\nis used) by our goldsmiths and for our homes.\" The Prophet [pbuh] then said:\n\"Except the lemon grass.\"\nIn this context, out of the spirit of revenge, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah killed a man\nfrom Laith Tribe. Here the Prophet was indignant and ordered Khuza‘ah to stop those\npre- Islamic practices. He, moreover, gave the family of anyone killed the right to\nconsider either of two options, blood- money or just retribution (the killer is killed).\nAfter having delivered his address, the Prophet [pbuh] rode to a small hill, Safa, not\nfar from Al- Ka‘bah. Turning his face towards the Sacred House, amidst a vast\nadmiring and devotional multitude, he raised his hand in fervent prayer to Allâh. The\ncitizens of Madinah who had gathered round him entertained fear, as Allâh had given\nhim victory over his native city, he might choose to stay here. He insisted on\nexplanation of their fear and so they spoke openly. He immediately dispelled their\nfears and assured them that he had lived with them and would die with them.\nImmediately after the great conquest, the Makkans came to realize that the only way\nto success lay in the avenue of Islam. They complied with the new realities and\ngathered to pledge fealty to the Prophet [pbuh]. The men came first pledging full\nobedience in all areas they can afford. Then came the women to follow the men’s\nexample. The Prophet [pbuh] with ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab receiving the pledge of\nfealty and communicating to them for him. Hind bint ‘Utbah",
  ", Abu Sufyan’s wife,\ncame in the trail of women disguised lest the Prophet [pbuh] should recognize and\naccount for her, having chewed the liver of Hamzah, his uncle. The Prophet [pbuh]\naccepted their allegiance on condition that they associate none with Allâh, to which\nthey immediately agreed. He added that they should not practise theft. Here Hind\ncomplained that her husband, Abu Sufyan, was tight- fisted. Her husband interrupted\ngranting all his worldly possessions to her. The Prophet [pbuh] laughed and\n\n-- 255 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n256\nrecognized the woman. She implored him to extend his pardon to her and efface all\nher previous sins. Some other conditions were appended including the prohibition of\nadultery, infanticide or forging falsehood. To all these orders, Hind replied positively\nswearing that she would not have come to take an oath of allegiance if she had had\nthe least seed of disobedience to him. On returning home, she broke her idol\nadmitting her delusion as regards stone- gods.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stayed in Makkah for 19 days. During that period he\nused to define the way to Islam, guide people to the orthodox path. He ordered Abu\nUsaid Al- Khuza‘i to restore the pillars of the Holy Sanctuary, sent missions to all\nquarters inviting them to adopt Islam and break down the graven images still lying in\nthe vicinity of Makkah, and he did have all of them scrapped, inculcating in the\nbelievers’ ears his words:\n\"Whoever believes in Allâh and the Hereafter is supposed to scrap out the\nidols that should happen to be in his house.\"\nShortly after the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] began to despatch platoons and\nerrands aiming at eliminating the last symbols reminiscent of pre- Islamic practices.\nHe sent Khalid bin Al- Waleed in Ramadan 8 A.H. to a spot called Nakhlah where\nthere was a goddess called Al- ‘Uzza venerated by Quraish and Kinanah tribes. It had\ncustodians from Bani Shaiban. Khalid, at the head of thirty horsemen arrived at the\nspot and exterminated it. On his return, the Prophet [pbuh] asked him if he had seen\nanything there, to which Khalid gave a negative answer. Here, he was told that it\nhad not been destroyed and he had to go there again and fulfill the task. He went\nback again and there he saw a black woman, naked with torn hair. Khalid struck her\nwith his sword into two parts. He returned and narrated the story to the Prophet\n[pbuh], who then confirmed the fulfillment of the task.\nLater, in the same month, ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As was sent on an errand to destroy another\nidol, venerated by Hudhail, called Suwa‘. It used to stand at a distance of three\nkilometres from Makkah. On a question posed by the door- keeper, ‘Amr said he had\nbeen ordered by the Prophet [pbuh] to knock down the idol. The man warned ‘Amr\nthat he would not be able to do it. ‘Amr was surprised to see someone still in the\nwrong, approached the idol and destroyed it, then he broke the casket beside it but\nfound nothing. The man immediately embraced Islam.\nSa‘d bin Zaid Al- Ashhali was also sent in the same month and on the same mission\nto Al- Mashallal to destroy an idol, Manat, venerated by both Al- Aws and Al- Khazraj\ntribes. Here also a black woman, naked with messy hair appeared wailing and\nbeating on her chest. Sa‘d immediately killed her, destroyed the idol and broke the\ncasket and returned at the conclusion of his errand.\nKhalid bin Al- Waleed at the head of 350 horsemen of Helpers, Emigrants and Bani\nSaleem was despatched once again in the same year 8 A.H. to the habitation of Bani\nKhuzaimah bedouins to invite them to the fold of Islam. He was instructed to carry\nout his mission with peace and goodwill. There, the people were not articulate\nenough to communicate their intentions, so Khalid ordered his men to kill them and\ntake the others as captives. He even had in mind to kill the captives but some of the\nCompanions were opposed to his plan. News of bloodshed reached the Prophet\n[pbuh]. He was deeply grieved and raised his hands towards the heaven, uttering\n\n-- 256 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n257\nthese words: \"O Allâh! I am innocent of what Khalid has done,\" twice. [Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/450, 2/622] He immediately sent ‘Ali to make every possible reparation to\nthe tribes who had been wronged. After a careful inquiry, ‘Ali paid the blood- money\nto all those who suffered loss. The remaining portion was also distributed amongst\nthe members of the tribe in order to alleviate their suffering. Khalid, due to his\nirrational behaviour, had a row with ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf. Hearing this, the\nProphet [pbuh] got angry, and ordered Khalid to stop that altercation adding that his\nCompanions (meaning ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf) were too high in rank to be involved\nin such arguments.\nThat is the story of the conquest of Makkah and the decisive battle that exterminated\npaganism once and for all. The other tribes in the Arabian Peninsula were waiting\nand closely watching the final outcome of the bitter struggle between the Muslims\nand idolaters, already convinced that the Holy Sanctuary would not fall but in the\nhands of the righteous party. It had been a conviction deeply established in their\nminds ever since the elephant army of Abraha Al- Ashram advanced from Yemen\nintending to destroy the Sacred House 50 years before.\nAl- Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty was the natural prelude to this great victory in which\npeople believed deeply and over which people talked a lot. The Muslims in Makkah,\nwho had feared to declare their Faith in public, began to appear and work ardently\nfor this new approach of life. People began to convert into Islam in hosts, and the\nMuslim army that numbered 3000 only in the previous \tGhazwah, now came to reach\n10,000 in number. In fact, this decisive change provided people with the keen insight\nto perceive things and the world around them as a whole in a different perceptive.\nThe Muslims were then to steer the whole political and religious affairs of all Arabia.\nThey had monopolised both the religious supremacy and temporal power.\nThe whole post- Hudaibiyah phase had been well- fledged in favour of the new Islamic\nmovement. Streams of the desert Arabians began to pour in paying full homage to\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], embracing the new faith and then carrying it to\ndifferent quarters for propagation.\n\n-- 257 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n258\nThe Third Stage\nThe third and last stage of the life of the Messenger [pbuh] embodies the fruitful\nresults of his call to Islam, which were the consequences of long- timed holy fights in\nthe way of Allâh ( \tJihad), troubles, toil, disturbances, trials and a lot of bloody\nconflicts and battles, which lasted for over twenty years.\nThe conquest of Makkah was considered the most serious profit achieved by Muslims\nduring those years. For it affected the course of events and consequently altered the\nArabs’ whole life. It was a decisive distinction between preconquest and post-\nconquest periods. For Quraish, at that time, was in the eyes of Arabs the defenders\nand helpers of Arabs. Other Arabs are only their ancillaries. The submission of\nQuraish is, therefore, estimated to be a final elimination of paganism in the Arabian\nPeninsula.\nThis stage can be divided into two main phases:\nThe phase of:\n1. \tholy wars and fighting.\n2. \tthe tribes and people’s race to embrace Islam.\nBeing so close and rather inseparable, the two phases of this stage intervene in such\na way that a happening of one phase occurs during the progress of the other.\nHowever, we have preferred — for expository purposes — to deal with these two\nphases distinctively. The fighting phase was given the priority in order, due to the\nfact that it is more intimate and fit than the other.\nHunain Ghazwah\nThe conquest of Makkah which came forth as a consequence of a swift blow\nastounded both the Arabs and other tribes who realized that they were doomed and\nhad to submit to the new situation as a \tfait \taccompli. Some of the fierce, powerful\nproud tribes did not submit and favoured resistance. Ahead of these were the septs\nof Hawazin and Thaqif. Nasr, Jashm and Sa‘d bin Bakr and people of Bani Hilal — all\nof whom of Qais ‘Ailan. They thought that they were too mighty to admit or\nsurrender to such a victory. So they met Malik bin ‘Awf An- Nasri and made up their\nmind to proceed fighting against the Muslims.\nThe Enemy’s March and their Encampment at Awtas\nWhen Malik bin ‘Awf — the general leader — decided to march and fight the Muslims,\nhe made his countrypeople take their wealth, women and children with them to\nAwtas — which is a valley in Hawazin land and is quite near Hunain. It differs from\nHunain in its being adjacent to Dhi- Al- Majaz which is around ten miles from Makkah\nin ‘Arafat’s direction. \t[Fath Al-Bari 8/27,42]\n\n-- 258 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n259\nThe War-experienced Man wrongs the Leader’s Judgement\nAs soon as they had camped in Awtas, people crowded round Malik. The old sane\nDuraid bin As- Simmah, who was well- known as a war- experienced man, and who\nwas among those who gathered round Malik, asked: \"What valley are we in?\" \"In\nAwtas,\" they said. \"What a good course it is for horses! It is neither a sharp pointed\nheight nor a loosed soiled plain. What? Why do I hear camels’ growling, the donkeys’\nbraying, the children’s cries and the sheep bleating?\" asked Duraid. They said: \"Malik\nbin ‘Awf had made people bring their women, properties and children with them.\" So\nhe called Malik and asked him what made him do such a thing. Malik said that his\naim was to have everybody’s family and properties around them so that they fight\nfiercely to protect them.\" \"I swear by Allâh that you are nothing but a shepherd,\"\nanswered Duraid, \"Do you believe that there is anything whatsoever, can stand in\nthe way of a defeated one or stop him from fleeing? If you win the battle you avail\nnothing but a man with a sword and a spear; but if you lose you will bring disgrace\non your people and properties,\" then he resumed his talk and went on wondering\nabout some septs and their leaders. \"O Malik, thrusting the distinguished people of\nHawazin into the battlefield will avail you nothing. Raise them up to where they can\nbe safe. Then make the young people mount their horses and fight. If you win, those\nwhom you tarried will follow you, but if you were the loser it would be a loss of a\nbattle, but your kinsmen, people and properties would not be lost.\"\nBut Malik, the general leader, refused this suggestion. \"By Allâh,\" he said, \"I will not\ndo such a thing. You must have grown a senile. Hawazin have to obey me, or else I\nwill lean my body against this sword so that it penetrates through my back.\" He\nrejected any sort of contribution of Duraid’s in that concern.\n\"We obey you,\" said his people, Duraid consequently said: \"Today is a day that I\nhave not missed but surely I will not be tempted to witness.\"\nReconnoitering the Weapons of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nThe spies that Malik had already dispatched to spy Muslim forces, returned with their\nlimbs cut off. \"Woe unto you! What happened to you?\" Said Malik. They said: \"We\nhave seen distinguished people on spotted horsebacks. What you see, would not\nhave happened if we had been firmly together.\"\nReconnoitering the Enemy’s Weapons\nNews about the enemy’s marching were conveyed to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh],\nso he sent out Al- Aslami with orders to mix with people, stay with them so that he\nwould be able to know their news and to convey it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nwhen he turns back. That was exactly what he managed to do.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] leaves Makkah for Hunain\nOn Shawwal, the nineteenth, the captive day, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left\nMakkah accompanied by twelve thousand Muslims. Ten thousand of those had\npreviously shared in Makkah Conquest. A great number of the other two thousand,\nwho were Makkans, had recently embraced Islam. That march was on the nineteenth\nday of his conquest to Makkah. He borrowed a hundred armours with their\n\n-- 259 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n260\nequipment from Safwan bin Omaiyah. He appointed ‘Itab bin Usaid as a governor\nover Makkah. When it was evening time, a horseman came to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] and said: \"I have climbed up so and so mountains and came across Hawazin\nwith their riding camels, livestock and sheep. Hawazin wholly were gathered together\nthere.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] smiled then and said: \"They will all be\nMuslims’ spoils tomorrow, if Allâh will.\" That night Anas bin Abi Murthid Al- Ghanawi\nvolunteered to guard. \t[Abu Da'ud]\nOn their way to Hunain they saw a great green \tNabk \tplant, that was called \tDhat-\nAnwat \t(the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their\nweapons on it, slay beasts under it and keep to it. So some of army members asked\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a \tNabk \twith suspenders as the one\nthey had. \"Allâh is the Greatest of all!\" He said, \"I swear by the One in Whose Hand\nis Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him.\nThey said ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people.\nThese are \tSunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who\npreceded you.\" \t[At-Tirmidhi]\nSeeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: \"We shall not be\ndefeated.\" Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\nThe Islamic Army stunned the Archers and the Attackers\nOn Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik\nbin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to\nhide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, narrow hiding\nplaces. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught\nsight of them and then to make a one- man attack against them.\nAt early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and\ndistributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn the Muslims\nmoved towards Hunain Valley. They started descending into it unaware of the\npresence of an enemy lurking for them inside the valley. So at the moment they\nwere camping, arrows began showering intensively at them, whereas the enemy’s\nbattalions started a fierce attack against the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder\nand utter confusion. It was such a shatteringly defeat that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who\nhad recently embraced Islam, said that their retreat would not stop till they got to\nthe Red Sea. Jablah or Kildah bin Al- Junaid commented on that by saying: \"Surely\nmagic has grown inactive today.\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to the right and said: \"Come on, people! I am\nthe Messenger of Allâh. I am Muhammad, the son of Abdullah.\" Those who stoodfast\nby him were only few Emigrants and some of his kinsmen. The matchless bravery of\nthe Prophet [R] was then brought to light. He went on and on in his attempts to\nmake his mule standfast in the face of the disbelievers while saying loudly:\n\"Truly saying, I am the Prophet\nI am the (grand) son of Abdul Muttalib.\"\n\n-- 260 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n261\nHowever, Abu Sufyan, who was then holding the rein of the Prophet’s mule, and Al-\n‘Abbas, who was holding its stirrup; were endeavouring to make it halt. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] dismounted and asked his Lord to render him help.\n\"O, Allâh, send down Your Help!\"\nMulsims’ return to the Battlefield, and the fierceness of the Fight\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered his uncle Al- ‘Abbas — who was a sonorous\nvoiced man — to call out on the followers. As loudly as he could, Al- ‘Abbas shouted:\n\"Where are the lancers?\" \"By Allâh,\" Al- ‘Abbas said, \"Upon hearing my voice calling\nthem back, they turned round to the battlefield as if they had been oryxes (wild\ncows) tending towards their calves.\"\n\"Here we are, at your service. Here we are.\" \t[Sahih Muslim 2/100] \tThey said. There you see\nthem trying to stop their camels and reverse to the battle. He who was unable to\nforce his camel to turn back, would take his armour, fling it round his neck, and\nhastily dismount his camel with his weapon in his hand letting his camel move freely\nand run towards the voice source. Voices would grow louder and louder till a hundred\nof them gathered round the Prophet and resumed the fight.\nThose who were called out upon next were Al- Ansar, the Helpers, \"O, folks of Al-\nAnsar! Folks of Al- Ansar!\"\nThe last group to be called out upon were Bani Al- Harith bin Al- Khazraj. Muslims\nbattalions poured successively into the battlefield in the same manner that they had\nleft it. The stamina of both parties was superb. Both of them stoodfast and fought\nfiercely. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was so eagerly and furiously watching the\nbattle that he said:\n\"Now the fight has grown fierce.\"\nPicking up a handful of earth, he hurled it at their faces while saying:\n\"May your faces be shameful.\"\nTheir eyes were thick with dust and the enemy began to retreat in utter confusion.\nReverse of Fortunes and the Enemy’s utter Defeat\nFew hours had elapsed since the earth- handful was hurled at the enemy’s faces,\nwhen they were shatteringly defeated. About seventy men of Thaqif alone were\nkilled, and the Muslims plundered all their riding camels, weapons and cattle.\nAllâh, Glory is to Him, alluded to this sudden change in the Qur’ân when He said:\n\"…and on the Day of Hunain (battle) when you rejoiced at your great\nnumber but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened\nfor you, then you turned back in flight. Then Allâh did send down His\nSakinah \t(calmness, tranquillity, and reassurance, etc.) on the Messenger\n\n-- 261 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n262\n(Muhammad [pbuh]) and on the believers, and sent down forces (angels)\nwhich you saw not, and punished the disbelievers. Such is the recompense\nof disbelievers.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:25,26]\nHot Pursuit of the Enemy\nAfter their defeat, some enemy troops headed for Ta’if, others to Nakhlah and Awtas.\nA group of Muslims headed by Abu ‘Amir Al- Ash‘ ari, were despatched to chase the\nenemy, some skirmishes took place during which Abu ‘Amir was killed.\nA similar battalion of horsemen pursued the idolaters who threaded the track to\nNakhlah and caught up with Duraid bin As- Simmah, who was killed by Rabi‘a bin\nRafi‘. After collecting the booty, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left for Ta’if to face\nthe greatest number of the defeated idolaters. The booty was six thousand captives,\ntwenty four thousand camels; over forty thousand sheep and four thousand silver\nounces. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave orders that booty should be confined at\nAl- J‘iranah and ordained Mas‘ud bin ‘Amr Al- Ghifari to be in charge of it. It was only\nwhen he was entirely free from Ta’if Campaign, that one of the captives As- Shaimâ’,\nthe daughter of Al- Harith As- Sa‘diya, the Messenger’s foster sister was brought to\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], she introduced herself to him. Upon recognizing her\nby a certain mark, he honoured her, spread for her his garment and seated her on it.\nHe was graceful and released her and made her turn back to her people.\nTa’if Campaign\nTa’if Campaign is in fact an extension of Hunain \tGhazwah; that is because the\nmajority of the defeated troops of Hawazin and Thaqif went into Ta’if with the\ngeneral commander — Malik bin ‘Awf An- Nasri — and fortified themselves within it.\nSo upon finishing with Hunain Invasion, he gathered the booty at Al- Ji‘ranah in the\nvery month (i.e. Shawwal) and in the eighth year A.H.\nA vanguard battalion of a thousand men led by Khalid bin Al- Waleed marched\ntowards At- Ta’if. Whereas the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] proceeded passing through\nNakhlah Al- Yamaniyah, Qarn Al- Manazil and through Laiyah. At Laiyah there was a\ncastle that belonged to Malik bin ‘Awf, so the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave orders\nto have it destroyed. He resumed his march till he got to Ta’if. There he dismounted,\ncamped near its castle and laid siege to the castle inhabitants; but not for long.\nHow long the siege continued, is still a matter of disagreement. It however stands\nbetween 10- 20 days. \t[Sahih Muslim, narrated by Anas [AWS]; Fath Al-Bari 8/45]\nA lot of arrow- shooting and rock- hurling occurred during the siege. For as soon as\nthe Muslims laid siege round the castle, its people started shooting arrows against\nthem. The arrows were so intense and fierce that they looked as if they had been\nlocusts on the move. A number of Muslims were wounded and twelve were killed.\nTo be far from the arrow- range, the Muslims had to ascend to a higher location and\ncamped on — i.e. to what is now called At- Ta’if Mosque. The Prophet [pbuh] set up a\nmangonel and shelled the castle. Eventually a gap was made in the castle wall,\nthrough which a number of Muslims managed to pass into the castle, sheltered by a\nwooden tank, with the purpose of setting fire into it. Anyway, the enemy poured\n\n-- 262 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n263\ndown molten hot iron on them. Affected by this the Muslims stepped out of the tank\nand were again exposed to arrow shooting and consequently some of them were\nkilled.\nTo force the enemy to surrender, the Prophet [pbuh] tended to a war policy of\nburning and cutting the enemy’s crops. His order was to cut their vineyards and burn\nthem. Seeing that the Muslims started rapidly cutting and burning their vines, they\nimplored the Prophet [pbuh] to stop and have mercy on them for the sake of Allâh\nand out of kinship motives. So the Prophet agreed. When the caller of the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] called out unto people saying \"He whosoever descends and steps out\nof the castle is free.\" Twenty- three men came out. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/620] One of\nthem was Abu Bakrah who tied himself to a wall and let himself down by means of a\nsmall wheel, that would normally be used for drawing up water from a well. The way\nhe let himself down made the Prophet nickname him \"Abu Bakrah\", i.e. the man with\nthe wheel. The Messenger of Allâh Õáì Çááå Úáíå æ Óáã set them all free and\nentrusted each one of them to a Muslim to care about their living affairs, which was\ntoo hard for the castle folkspeople to bear.\nSeeing that the siege lasted too long and that the castle was immune and could\nstand any siege (for they had already stored a supply that suffices for over a year)\nand that the Muslims were suffering — day by day — from arrow- shots and heated\niron hooks, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] consulted Nawfal bin Mu‘âwiyah Ad- Daili\nabout that. He said: \"They are like a fox hiding inside its burrow. If you stoodfast at\nit you would catch it, but if you parted with it, no harm would afflict you.\" The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] decided to lift the siege and depart. ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab,\nwho was ordered by the Prophet to notify people, said to them \"If Allâh will, we are\nleaving the castle and going back tomorrow.\" As it was too hard for the Muslims to\ngo back and leave the castle unconquered they complained saying, \"Should we go\naway while the castle is still unopened?\" His reply was: \"Then, start fighting in the\nmorning.\" In the morning they fought and were wounded. So when he repeated this\nstatement: \"If Allâh will, we are leaving the castle and going back tomorrow\", they\nwere pleased and carried out the order submissively and started moving, which\nmade the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] laugh.\nAs soon as they mounted and started moving the Messenger [pbuh] said:\n\"Say! Here we are returning, repenting, worshipping (Allâh) and to our Lord\nwe offer praise.\"\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh was asked to invoke Allâh against Thaqif, he said:\n\"O Allâh, guide Thaqif and bring them to us as Muslims.\"\nThe Distribution of the Booty at Al-Ji‘ranah\nUpon returning and lifting the siege in Ta’if, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had\nstayed over ten nights at Al- Ji‘ranah before starting to distribute the booty.\nDistribution delay was due to the Prophet’s hope that Hawazin’s delegation might\narrive and announce their repentance and consequently reclaim their loss. Seeing\nthat none of them arrived, he started dividing the booty so as to calm down the\ntribes’ chiefs and the celebrities of Makkah. The first to receive booty and the ones\n\n-- 263 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n264\nwho obtained the greatest number of shares were the people who had recently\nembraced Islam.\nAbu Sufyan bin Harb was given a hundred camels and forty (gold) ounces and yet he\nsaid, \"What about my son, Yazeed’s Share?\" So he was given the same quantity for\nhis son as well. But yet he exclaimed: \"And what about the share of Mu‘âwiyah, my\nsecond son?\" So the Prophet [pbuh] gave Mu‘âwiyah as much as he gave his father\nand brother. Hakeem bin Hizam was given a hundred camels, but he was given a\nhundred more when he demanded. Safwan bin Omaiyah was given three hundred\ncamels - a hundred camels at each time. It is thus mentioned in Shifâ’ [Ash- Shifa\n1/86], Book by Qadi Iyadh. The Prophet [pbuh] gave Al- Harith bin Harith bin Kilda a\nhundred camels. He also gave some chiefs of Quraish and other clans a hundred\ncamels; he gave others fifty and some others had forty.\nEventually it was spread among people that \"Muhammad grants generously and\nfears not to grow poor.\" This made bedouins gather around him expecting to be\ngiven some wealth. They were so many that they forced the Prophet [pbuh] to seek\nrefuge against a tree and they even took away his garment, \"O people!\" He said,\n\"Give me back my garment! For I swear by the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s\nsoul, that if I had as many numerous camels as the number of Tihama trees, I would\ndistribute them among you. You know quite well that I am neither mean nor coward\nor a liar.\" Standing by his camel he plucked out a hair of his camel’s hump and held\nit between his two fingers, lifted it up and said: \"O people, I swear by Allâh that I get\nnothing but one- fifth of your booty, and this very fifth goes back to you.\"\nAs soon as he had given the new converts, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered\nZaid bin Thabit to fetch the booty and summon people. Then he ordained shares to\npeople. A footman’s share was four camels and forty sheep, and a horseman would\ntake twelve camels and a hundred and twenty sheep. This distribution of booty was\nbased on a wise policy. In this world there are lots of people who know the truth only\nwhen it comes through their stomachs and they do not recognize it if it comes\nthrough their brains. The similitude of such people is as the guidance of an animal to\nits herd by means of a bunch of clover held at a constant distance off its mouth. The\nanimal would try all the time to catch it, so it would eventually go into the herd\nsafely. In the same way you have to do various kinds of temptations to make certain\nkind of people familiarize Islam and be pleased with. \t[Fiqh As-Seerah p.298,299]\nThe Helpers (Al-Ansar) are furious at the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nAt first the Prophet’s policy of distribution was uncomprehended by many a man.\nTherefore sharp- tongued people started expressing their objections. The Helpers\nwere among those who were afflicted by this policy. They were deprived of Hunain\ngifts though they had been the ones who were summoned at Hunain hard times and\nthey were the first to rush to fight with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and standfast\ntill the defeat turned into victory. Now here they are watching those who escaped fill\ntheir hands with booty while they are given nothing.\nOn the authority of Ibn Ishaq: \"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had given\nQuraish and Arab tribes those gifts and allotted nothing to the Helpers, a group of\nthe Helpers felt so uneasy about it that a lot of ill- statements against the Prophet\n[pbuh] were spread among them to an extent that one of them said: \"By Allâh, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] was ill- spoken of by his folksmen!\" And those ill-\n\n-- 264 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n265\nstatements went on spreading till Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah met the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh], who in his turn faced his people after a while.\nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, this group of the Helpers are furious at\nyou about the distribution of the booty that you had won. You have allotted shares to\nyour own kinsmen and forwarded lots of gifts to the Arab tribes. But this group has\nobtained nothing.\" The Prophet [pbuh] asked Sa‘d exclaiming: \"Sa‘d, what do you\nthink of all that?\" Sa‘d replied: \"O Messenger of Allâh. You know that I am nothing\nbut a member of this group.\" \"Call out on your people and bring them forth to me\ninto this shed.\" Said the Prophet [pbuh].\nSo Sa‘d went out and summoned them. When some Emigrants came, he let them in\nbut forbade others. When they were all gathered together, he informed the Prophet\nsaying: \"This group of the Helpers have just arrived to meet you in compliance with\nyour orders.\" As soon as the Messenger [pbuh] faced them he thanked Allâh and\npraised Him, then said to them inquiring, \"I have been told that you are angry with\nme. Didn’t I come to you when you were astray and Allâh guided you? You were poor\nand Allâh gave you wealth. Weren’t you foes and Allâh made you love one another.\"\n\"Yes,\" they said, \"Allâh and His Messenger are better and more gracious.\" Then he\nsaid: \"What prevents you from replying to the Messenger of Allâh, O tribe of\nHelpers?\" They said, \"What should be the reply, O Messenger of Allâh, while to the\nLord and to his Messenger belong all benevolence and grace.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] again said:\n\"But by Allâh, you might have answered and answered truly, for I would\nhave testified to its truth myself: ‘You came to us belied and rejected and\nwe accepted you; you came to us as helpless and we helped you; a fugitive,\nand we took you in; poor and we comforted you’.\nYou Helpers, do you feel anxious for the things of this world, wherewith I\nhave sought to incline these people unto the Faith in which you are already\nestablished?\nAre you not satisfied, O group of Helpers that the people go with ewes and\ncamels while you go along with the Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh]) to your\ndwellings. By Him i",
  "n Whose Hand is my life, had there been no migration, I\nwould have been one of the Helpers. If the people would go through a valley\nand passage, and the Helpers go through another valley and passage, I\nwould go through the valley and passage of the Helpers. Allâh! Have mercy\non the Helpers, their children and their children’s children.\"\nThe audience wept until tears rolled down their beards as they said:\n\"Yes, we are satisfied, O Prophet of Allâh ([pbuh] )! with our lot and share.\"\nThen the Prophet [pbuh] left the gathering and the people also dispersed. \t[Ibn Hisham\n2/499,500; and like this quoted by Bukhari 2/620, 621]\n\n-- 265 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n266\nArrival of the Hawazin Delegation\nHawazin’s delegation arrived a Muslims just after the distribution of spoils. They were\nfourteen men headed by Zuhair bin Sard. The Messenger’s foster uncle was one of\nthem. They asked him to bestow upon them some of the wealth and spoils. They\nuttered so touching words that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to them: \"You\nsurely see who are with me. The most desirable speech to me is the most truthful.\nWhich is dearer to you, your wealth or your women and children?\" They replied:\n\"Nothing whatsoever compares with kinship.\" Then when I perform the noon prayer,\nstand up and say: \"We intercede with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to exhort the\nbelievers, and we intercede with the believers to exhort the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] to forego the captives of our people fallen to their lot.\" So when the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] performed the noon prayer, they stood up and said what\nthey had been told to say. The Messenger [pbuh], then, said: \"As for what belongs\nto me and to the children of Abdul Muttalib, you may consider them, from now on,\nyours. And I will ask my folksmen to give back theirs.\" Upon hearing that the\nEmigrants and the Helpers said: \"What belongs to us is, from now on, offered to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh].\" But Al- Aqra‘ bin Habis said, \"We will grant none of what\nbelongs to me and to Bani Tamim,\"; so did ‘Uyaina bin Hisn, who said: \"As for me\nand Bani Fazarah, I say ‘No’.\" Al- ‘Abbas bin Mirdas also refused and said: \"No\" for\nBani Saleem and him. His people, however, said otherwise: \"Whatever spoils belong\nto us we offer to the Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh].)\" \"You have undermined my\nposition.\" Said Al- ‘Abbas bin Mirdas spontaneously. Then the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] said: \"These people have come to you as Muslims. For this I have already\ntarried the distribution of the booty. Besides, I have granted them a fair option but\nthey refused to have anything other than their women and children. Therefore he\nwho has some of theirs and will prefer willingly to give them back, let them do. But\nthose who favours to keep what he owns to himself, let them grant them back too,\nand he will be given as a recompense six times as much from the first booty that\nAllâh may provide us.\" People then said, \"We will willingly offer them all for the sake\nof the Messenger of Allâh.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"But in this way we\nare not able to find out who is content and who is not. So go back and we will be\nwaiting for your chiefs to convey to us your decisions.\" All of them gave back the\nwomen and children. The only one who refused to comply with the Messenger’s\ndesire was ‘Uyaina bin Hisn. He refused to let an old woman of theirs go back at first.\nLater on he let her go back. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave every captive a\ngarment as a gift.\nLesser Pilgrimage (Al-‘Umrah) to Makkah and leaving for Madinah\nHaving accomplished the distribution of the spoils at Al- Ji‘ranah he left it while\nwearing \tAl- ‘Umrah \tclothes and proceeded to Makkah to perform \tAl- ‘Umrah. \tThe\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned back from there to Madinah after appointing ‘Itab\nbin Usaid on Makkah as governor. His arrival to Madinah was by the last six nights of\nDhul- Qa‘dah, in the year 8 A.H. On this occasion Muhammad Al- Ghazali said:\n\"What a great change it is between the victorious period of Muhammad at present\nwhich Allâh has towered with a manifest conquest, and that period of the past during\nwhich Muhammad first arrived at this town, eight years ago.\"\nWhen he first came to Madinah, he was pursued and wanted. He was seeking a\nsecure shelter. He was a lonely stranger who sought companionship and comfort.\n\n-- 266 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n267\nThe people of Madinah welcomed him, gave him residence and aided him and\nembraced the light of Islam, which had been sent down upon him. They, for his sake,\ndid not care about the enmity of other peoples. Here he is entering Madinah again,\nafter the lapse of eight years of that first visit. Madinah, the town that had received\nhim once, when he was a frightened Emigrant; it receives him once again when\nMakkah has become in his hands and at his disposal. It is Makkah that has got rid of\nits pride and \tJahiliyah \t(i.e. pre- Islamic period and traditions). It is now proud again\nand mighty in Islam. The Messenger of Allâh forgave all the errors and wrongs of its\npeople.\n\"Verily, he who fears Allâh with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins\nand evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient,\nthen surely, Allâh makes not the reward of the good- doers to be lost.\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 12:90] [Fiqh- us- Seerah 303; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/160- 201; Ibn Hisham 2/389-\n501; Sahih Bukhari: Chapter Fath Ghazwal, Hunian, Awtas and At- Ta'if 2/612- 622.\nFath Al- Bari 8/3- 58]\n\n-- 267 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n268\nMissions and Platoons\nAfter the Conquest\nUpon returning from this long successful travel, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nstayed in Madinah where he received delegates and dispatched agents and appointed\npreachers and callers to Islam everywhere. Those whose hearts were still full of\nprejudice against Islam and therefore were too proud to embrace Allâh’s religion,\nwere decisively muffled on their non- acquiescence in the \tstatus quo \tprevalent then in\nArabia.\nHere is a mini- image about the believed ones. We have already stated that the\nMessenger’s arrival in Madinah was by the last days of the eighth year of Al- Hijra. No\nsooner the crescent of Muharram of the ninth year turned up than the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] dispatched the believed ones, to the tribes as shown in the list below:\n1. ‘Uyaina bin Hisn \tto Bani Tamim.\n2. Yazeed bin Husain \tto Aslam and Ghifar.\n3. ‘Abbad bin Bishr Al- Ashhali \tto Sulaim and Muzainah.\n4. Rafi‘ bin Mukaith \tto Juhainah.\n5. ‘Amr bin Al- ‘As \tto Bani Fazarah.\n6. Ad- Dahhak bin Sufyan \tto Bani Kilab.\n7. Basheer bin Sufyan \tto Bani Ka‘b.\n8. Ibn Al- Lutabiyah Al- Azdi \tto Bani Dhubyan.\n9. Al- Muhajir bin Abi Omaiyah to Sana‘a’ (Al- Aswad Al- ‘Ansi called at him\nwhen he was in it).\n10. Ziyad bin Labid \tto Hadramout.\n11. ‘Adi bin Hatim \tto Tai’ and Bani Asad.\n12. Malik bin Nuwairah \tto Bani Hanzalah.\n13. Az- Zabraqan bin Badr \tto Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them).\n14. Qais bin ‘Asim \tto Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them).\n15. Al- ‘Alâ’ bin Al- Hadrami \tto Al- Bahrain.\n16. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib \tto Najran (to collect \tSadaqa \t& \tJizya).\nSome of these agents were despatched in Muharram, 7 A.H., others were sent later\nuntil the tribes they were heading for had completely converted into Islam. Such a\nmove clearly demonstrates the great success that the Islamic \tDa‘wah \t(Call) enjoyed\nafter Al- Hudaibiyah Treaty. However, shortly after the conquest of Makkah, people\nbegan to embrace Islam in large hosts.\nThe Platoons\nIn the same way that the believed ones were dispatched to the tribes, we\nunderstand that dispatching some more platoons to all regions of Arabia is a\nnecessity for the prevalence and domination of security on all lands of Arabia.\nHere is a list of those platoons:\n1. \t‘Uyaina bin Hisn Al- Fazari’s platoon in Al- Muharram, the ninth year of Al- Hijra\nto Bani Tamim. It consisted of fifty horsemen, none of them was an Emigrant\nor a Helper.\n\n-- 268 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n269\nThis expedition was dispatched due to the fact that Bani Tamim had already\nurged other tribes not to pay tribute (Al- Jizya) and eventually stopped them\nfrom paying it.\nTherefore, ‘Uyaina bin Hisn set out to fight them. All the way long he marched\nby night and lurked by day. He went on that way till he overtook them and\nattacked them in the desert. They fled back for their lives. Eleven men,\ntwenty- one women and thirty boys were captured then. He drove them back\nto Madinah and were housed in Ramlah bint Al- Harith’s residence. Ten of their\nleaders, who came to the Prophet’s door, called out unto him saying: \"O\nMuhammad come out and face us.\" When he went out they held him and\nstarted talking.\nHe exchanged talk with them for a while then left them and went to perform\nthe noon- prayer. After prayer he sat in the mosque- patio. They proclaimed a\ndesire to show boasting and self- pride. For this purpose they introduced their\norator ‘Utarid bin Hajib who delivered his speech. The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] asked Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas — the Muslim orator — to\nrespond. He did that. In return, they brought forth their poet Az- Zabraqan bin\nBadr who recited some boastful poetry. Hassan bin Thabit, the poet of Islam,\npromptly replied back. When talks and poetry came to an end, Al- Aqra‘ bin\nHabis said: \"Their orator is more eloquent than ours, and their poet is more\npoetically learned than ours. Their voices and sayings excel ours, as well.\"\nEventually they announced their embracing Islam. Consequently, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] acknowledged their Islamization, awarded them\nwell, and rendered them back their women and children.\n2. \tA platoon headed by Qutbah bin ‘Amir to a spot called Khath‘am in Tabalah, a\nplot of land not far from Turbah. That was in Safar, 9 A.H. Accompanied by\ntwenty men and only ten camels to mount alternatively on, Qutbah raided\nthem and fought so fiercely that a great number of both parties were\nwounded and some others were killed. The Muslims drove back with them\ncamels, women and sheep to Madinah.\n3. \tThe mission of Dahhak bin Sufyan Al- Kilabi to Bani Kilab in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal in\nthe year 9 A.H. This mission was sent to Bani Kilab to call them to embrace\nIslam. Refusing to embrace Islam, they started to fight against the Muslims,\nbut were defeated and sustained one man killed.\n4. \tThe three hundred men expedition of ‘Alqamah bin Mujazziz Al- Mudlaji to\nJeddah shores in Rabi‘ Al- Akhir. This expedition was dispatched to fight\nagainst some men from (Al- Habasha) Abyssinia (Ethiopia), who gathered\ntogether near the shores of Jeddah and exercised acts of piracy against the\nMakkans. Therefore he crossed the sea till he got to an island. But as soon as\nthe pirates had learned of Muslims’ arrival, they fled. \t[Fath Al-Bari 8/59]\n5. \tThe task of the platoon of ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was to demolish Al- Qullus, which\nwas an idol that belonged to Tai’ tribe. That was in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal in the year\n9 A.H. ‘Ali was dispatched by the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] with one hundred\nfifty men. A hundred of them were on camels. The other fifty were on\nhorseback. He held a black flag and a white banner.\nAt dawn they raided \tMahallat \tHatim, demolished the idol and filled their\nhands with spoils, camels and sheep booties, whereas ‘Adi fled to Ash- Sham.\nThe sister of ‘Adi bin Hatim was one of the captives. Inside Al- Qullus safe,\n\n-- 269 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n270\nMuslims found three swords and three armours. On the way they distributed\nthe spoils and put aside the best things to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\nThey did not share the Hatims.\nUpon arrival in Madinah, the sister of ‘Adi bin Hatim begged the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] to have mercy on her and said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, my\nbrother is absent and father is dead, and I am too old to render any service.\nBe beneficent to me so that Allâh may be bountiful to you.\" He said: \"Who is\nyour brother?\" She said: \"It is ‘Adi bin Hatim.\" \"Is he not the one who fled\nfrom Allâh and his Messenger?\" Said the Prophet [pbuh] then went away from\nher. Next day she reiterated the same thing as the day before and received\nthe same answer. A day later she uttered similar words, this time he made\nbenefaction to her. The man who was beside the Prophet, and whom she\nthought to be ‘Ali, said to her: \"Ask for an animal from him to ride on.\" And\nshe was granted her request.\nShe returned to Ash- Sham where she met her brother and said to him: \"The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] has done me such noble deed that your father\nwould never have done it. Therefore, willy- nilly, frightened or secure, you\nshould go and see him.\" Unsecure neither protected by some one, not even\nrecommended by a letter as a means of protection, ‘Adi came and met the\nProphet. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] took him home with him. As soon as\nhe sat before him, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] thanked Allâh and praised\nhim, then said: \"What makes you flee? Do you flee lest you should say there\nis no god but Allâh? Do you know any other god but Allâh?\" \"No\" he said,\nthen talked for a while. The Messenger of Allâh went on saying: \"Certainly\nyou flee so that you may not hear the statement saying ‘Allâh is the\nGreatest.’ Do you know anyone who is greater than Allâh?\" \"No\" he said. \"The\nJews are those whose portion is wrath, and the Christians are those who have\ngone astray,\" the Prophet retorted. \"I am a Muslim and I believe in one God\n(Allâh).\" ‘Adi finally proclaimed with a joyous face. The Prophet ordered him a\nresidence with one of the Helpers. From that time he started calling at the\nProphet [pbuh] in the mornings and in the evenings. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/205]\nOn the authority of Ibn Ishaq, when the Prophet [pbuh] made him sit down in\nfront of him in his house, the Prophet said, \"O ‘Adi, were you not cast in\ndisbelief?\" \"Yes\". ‘Adi said. \"Did you not share one quarter of your people’s\ngains?\" \"Yes\". Said ‘Adi. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"It is sinful in\nyour religion to do such a thing, and you should not allow yourself to do it.\"\n\"Yes, by Allâh, that is true\", said ‘Adi. \"Thus I worked out that he was a\nProphet inspired by Allâh, and sent to people. He knows what is unknown.\" \t[Ibn\nHisham 2/581]\nIn another version, the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"‘Adi, embrace Islam and you\nshall be secure.\" \"But I am a man of religion.\" Said ‘Adi. \"I know your religion\nbetter than you.\" Said the Prophet. \"Do you know my religion better than\nme?\" ‘Adi asked. The Prophet replied, \"Yes\". He said: \"Are you not cast in\ndisbelief because you appropriate to yourself the fourth of your people’s\ngains?\" \"Yes\". Said ‘Adi. \"It is unlawful in your religion to do such a thing.\"\nThe Prophet said, and ‘‘Adi added: \"He did not need to say it again for I\nimmediately acquiesced it.\" \t[Musnad Imam Ahmad]\n\n-- 270 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n271\nAl- Bukhari narrates that ‘Adi said: While we were with the Prophet [pbuh], a man\ncame in and complained to him about poverty. Then another man came in and\ncomplained about highway robbery. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then said: \"O\n‘Adi, have you ever been to Al- Hirah? If you were doomed to live long life, you would\nbe able to see a riding camel woman travel from Hirah till it circumambulates Al-\nKa‘bah fearing none but Allâh; and if you were to live long enough you would open\nthe treasures of Kisra. And if you were to live long you would be able to see man\noffering a handful of gold or silver to others but none accepts to take it.\" At the end\nof this \tHadith \t‘Adi later on says: \"I have seen a riding camel woman travel from Al-\nHirah till it circumambulates the Ka‘bah fearing none but Allâh, I have also been one\nof those who opened the treasures of Kisra bin Hurmuz. If you were to live long life\nyou would witness what the Prophet, Abul Qasim, [pbuh] had already said about\n‘offering a handful of …’ i.e. the Prophet’s prophecies did really come true.\" \t[Sahih Al-\nBukhari; Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/524]\n\n-- 271 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n272\nThe Invasion of Tabuk\nin Rajab, in the Year 9 A.H.\nThe invasion and the conquest of Makkah was considered a decisive one between the\ntruth and the error. As a result of which, the Arabs had no more doubt in\nMuhammad’s mission. Thus we see that things went contrary to the pagans’\nexpectations. People started to embrace Islam, the religion of Allâh, in great\nnumbers. This is manifested clearly in the chapter — The delegations, of this book. It\ncan also be deduced out of the enormous number of people who shared in the\nHajjatul- Wadâ‘ \t(Farewell Pilgrimage). All domestic troubles came to an end. Muslims,\neventually felt at ease and started setting up the teachings of Allâh’s Laws and\nintensifying the Call to Islam.\nThe underlying Reasons\nThe Byzantine power, which was considered the greatest military force on earth at\nthat time, showed an unjustifiable opposition towards Muslims. As we have already\nmentioned, their opposition started at killing the ambassador of the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh], Al- Harith bin ‘Umair Al- Azdi, by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr Al- Ghassani. The\nambassador was then carrying a message from the Prophet [pbuh] to the ruler of\nBusra. We have also stated that the Prophet consequently dispatched a brigade\nunder the command of Zaid bin Haritha, who had a fierce fight against the\nByzantines at Mu’tah. Although Muslim forces could not have revenge on those\nhaughty overproud tyrants, the confrontation itself had a great impression on the\nArabs, all over Arabia.\nCaesar — who could neither ignore the great benefit that Mu’tah Battle had brought\nto Muslims, nor could he disregard the Arab tribes’ expectations of independence,\nand their hopes of getting free from his influence and reign, nor he could ignore their\nalliance to the Muslims — realizing all that, Caesar was aware of the progressive\ndanger threatening his borders, especially Ash- Sham- fronts which were neighbouring\nArab lands. So he concluded that demolition of the Muslims power had grown an\nurgent necessity. This decision of his should, in his opinion, be achieved before the\nMuslims become too powerful to conquer, and raise troubles and unrest in the\nadjacent Arab territories.\nTo meet these exigencies, Caesar mustered a huge army of the Byzantines and pro-\nRoman Ghassanide tribes to launch a decisive bloody battle against the Muslims.\nGeneral News about the Byzantines and Ghassanide Preparations for War\nNo sooner news about the Byzantine’s preparations for a decisive invasion against\nMuslims reached Madinah than fear spread among them. They started to envisage\nthe Byzantine invasion in the least sound they could hear. This could be clearly\nworked out of what had happened to ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab one day.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had taken an oath to stay off his wives for a month in the ninth\nyear of Al- Hijra. Therefore, he deserted them and kept off in a private place. At the\nbeginning, the Companions of the Messenger of Allâh were puzzled and could not\nwork out the reason for such behaviour. They thought the Prophet [pbuh] had\n\n-- 272 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n273\ndivorced them and that was why he was grieved, disturbed and upset. In ‘Umar’s\nversion of the very story he says: \"I used to have a Helper friend who often informed\nme about what happened if I weren’t present, and in return I always informed him of\nwhat had taken place during his absence. They both lived in the high part of\nMadinah. Both of them used to call at the Prophet alternatively during that time of\nsuspense. Then one day I heard my friend, knock at the door saying: \"Open up!\nOpen up!\" I asked wondering, \"What’s the matter? Has the Ghassanide come?\" \"No it\nis more serious than that. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has deserted his wives.\"\n[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/730]\nIn another version, ‘Umar said, \"We talked about Ghassanide preparations to invade\nus. When it was his turn to convey the news to me, he went down and returned in\nthe evening. He knocked at the door violently and said ‘Is he sleeping?’ I was\nterrified but I went out to meet him. ‘Something serious had taken place.’ He said.\n‘Has the Ghassaindes arrived?’ Said I. ‘No,’ he said, ‘it is greater and more serious.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has divorced his wives.’\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/334]\nThis state of too much alertness manifests clearly the seriousness of the situation\nthat Muslims began to experience. The seriousness of the situation was confirmed to\na large degree by the hypocrites behaviour, when news about the Byzantines’\npreparations reached Madinah. The fact that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] won all\nthe battles he fought, and that no power on earth could make him terrified, and that\nhe had always proved to be able to overcome all the obstacles that stood in his way -\ndid not prevent the hypocrites, who concealed evil in their hearts, from expecting an\naffliction to fall upon the Muslims and Islam.\nThey used to harbour evil and ill- intentions against the whole process of Islam and\nthe Muslims. On grounds of illusory hopes of destroying this great religious edifice,\nthey erected a hotbed of conspiracy and intrigue in the form of a mosque — \tMasjid-\ne- Darar \t(the mosque of harm). They approached the Prophet [pbuh] with the\nrequest that he should come and consecrate the place by praying in it himself. As he\nwas at the moment about to start for Tabuk, he deferred compliance with their\nrequest till his return. Meanwhile he came to know through Divine Revelation that it\nwas not a Mosque for devotion and prayer but a meeting place for the anti- Islamic\nelements. On his return, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] sent a party to demolish the\nnew structure.\nParticular News about the Byzantine and Ghassanide Preparations for War\nA magnified image of the prominent danger threatening the Muslims life was carried\nto them by the Nabateans who brought oil from Ash- Sham to Madinah. They carried\nnews about Heraclius’ preparations and equipment of an enormous army counting\nover forty thousand fighters besides Lukham, Judham and other tribes allied to the\nByzantines. They said that its vanguard had already reached Al- Balqâ’. Thus was the\ngrave situation standing in ambush for the Muslims. The general situation was\naggravated seriously by other adverse factors of too much hot weather, drought and\nthe rough and rugged distance they had to cover in case they decided to encounter\nthe imminent danger.\nThe Messenger of Allâh’s [pbuh] concept and estimation of the situation and its\ndevelopment was more precise and accurate than all others. He thought that if he\ntarried or dealt passively with the situation in such a way that might enable the\n\n-- 273 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n274\nByzantines to paddle through the Islamic controlled provinces or to go as far as\nMadinah, this would — amid these circumstances — leave the most awful impression\non Islam as well as on the Muslims’ military credibility.\nThe pre- Islamic beliefs and traditions (Al- Jahiliyah) which were at that time dying\nbecause of the strong decisive blow that they had already had at Hunain, could have\nhad a way to come back to life once again in such an environment. The hypocrites\nwho were conspiring against the Muslims so that they might stab them in the back\nwhereas Byzantines would attack them from the front. If such a thing came to light\nand they succeeded in their evil attempts, the Prophet and his Companions’ efforts to\nspread Islam would collapse and their profits which were the consequences of\nsuccessive and constant fights and invasions would be invalidated. The Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] realised all that very well. So — in spite of the hardships and drought\nthat Muslims were suffering from — the Prophet [pbuh] was determined that the\nMuslims should invade the Byzantines and fight a decisive battle at their own\nborders. He was determined not to tarry at all in order to thwart any Roman attempt\nto approach the land of Islam.\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had made up his mind and took his final\ndecision, he ordered his Companions to get ready for war and sent for the Makkans\nand the other Arab tribes asking for their assistance.\nContrary to his habit of concealing his real intention of the invasion by means of\ndeclaring a false one, he announced openly his intention of meeting the Byzantines\nand fighting them. He cleared the situation to his people so that they would get\nready, and urged them to fight in the way of Allâh. On this occasion a part of \tSurat\nBara’a \t(Chapter 9 — The Repentance) was sent down by Allâh, urging them to\nsteadfastness and stamina.\nOn the other hand, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] cherished them to pay charities\nand to spend the best of their fortunes in the way of Allâh.\nNo sooner had the Muslims heard the voice of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] calling\nthem to fight the Byzantines than they rushed to comply with his orders. With great\nspeed they started getting ready for war. Tribes and phratries from here and there\nbegan pouring in Madinah. Almost all the Muslims responded positively. Only those\nwho had weakness at their hearts favoured to stay behind. They were only three\npeople. Even the needy and the poor who could not afford a ride came to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] asking for one so that they would be able to share in the\nfight against the Byzantines. But when he said:\n\"...‘I can find no mounts for you’ they turned back while their eyes\noverflowing with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend\n(for \tJihad).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:92]\nThe Muslims raced to spend out money and to pay charities to provide this invasion.\n‘Uthman, for instance, who had already rigged two hundred, saddled camels to travel\nto Ash- Sham, presented them all with two hundred ounces (of gold) as charity. He\nalso fetched a thousand dinars and cast them all into the lap of the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh], who turned them over and said: \"From this day on nothing will harm\n‘Uthman regardless of what he does.\" \t[Jami' At- Tirmidhi 2/211 (The virtues of 'Uthman)] \tAgain\n\n-- 274 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n275\nand again ‘Uthman gave till his charity toped to nine hundred camels and a hundred\nhorses, besides the money he paid.\nAbdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, on his side, paid two hundred silver ounces, whereas Abu\nBakr paid the whole money he had and left nothing but Allâh and His Messenger as a\nfortune for his family. ‘Umar paid half his fortune. Al- ‘Abbas gifted a lot of money.\nTalhah, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah and Muhammad bin Maslamah, gave money for the welfare\nof the invasion. ‘Asim bin ‘Adi, on his turn, offered ninety camel- burdens of dates.\nPeople raced to pay little and much charities alike. One of them gave the only half\nbushel (or the only bushel) he owned. Women shared in this competition by giving\nthe things they owned; such as musk, armlets, anklets, ear- rings and rings. No one\nabstained from spending out money, or was too mean to grant money or anything\nexcept the hypocrites:\n\"Those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in Allâh’s cause)\nvoluntarily, and those who could not find to give charity (in Allâh’s cause)\nexcept what is available to them, so they mock at them (believers).\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 9:79]\nThe Muslim Army is leaving for Tabuk\nUpon accomplishing the equipment of the army, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nordained that Muhammad bin Maslamah Al- Ansari should be appointed over Madinah\n— in another version Siba‘ bin ‘Arftah. To ‘Ali bin Abu Talib he entrusted his family’s\nsafety and affairs and ordered him to stay with them. This move made the hypocrites\nundervalue ‘Ali, so he followed the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and caught up with\nhim. But the Prophet made ‘Ali turn back to Madinah after saying: \"Would it not\nsuffice you to be my successor in the way that Aaron (Harun) was to Moses’?\" Then\nhe proceeded saying: \"But no Prophet succeeds me.\"\nOn Thursday, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] marched northwards to Tabuk. The\narmy that numbered thirty thousand fighters was a great one, when compared with\nthe previous armies of Islam. Muslims had never marched with such a great number\nbefore.\nDespite all the gifts of wealth and mounts the army was not perfectly equipped. The\nshortage of provisions and mounts was so serious that eighteen men mounted one\ncamel alternatively. As for provisions, members of the army at times had to eat the\nleaves of trees till their lips got swollen. Some others had to slaughter camels —\nthough they were so dear — so that they could drink the water of their stomach;\nthat is why that army was called \"The army of distress\".\nOn their way to Tabuk, the army of Islam passed by Al- Hijr — which was the native\nland of Thamud who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley; that is \"Al- Qura Valley\" of\ntoday. They watered from its well but later the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told them\nnot to drink of that water, nor perform the ablution with it. The dough they made, he\nasked them to feed their camels with. He forbade them to eat anything whatsoever\nof it. As an alternative he told them to water from that well which Prophet Salih’s\nshe- camel used to water from.\nOn the authority of Ibn ‘Umar: \"Upon passing by Al- Hijr the Prophet [pbuh] said:\n\n-- 275 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n276\n\"Do not enter the houses of those who erred themselves lest what had\nhappened to them would afflict you, but if you had to do such a thing let it\nbe associated with weeping.\"\nThen he raised his head up and accelerated his strides till he passed the valley out.\"\n[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/637]\nShortage of water and the army’s need to it made them complain to the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] about that. So he supplicated Allâh, who sent a rainful cloud. It\nrained and so all people drank and supplied themselves with their need of water.\nWhen they drew near Tabuk, the Prophet said: \"If Allâh will, tomorrow you will arrive\nat Tabuk spring. You will not get there before daytime. So whoever reaches it should\nnot touch its water; but wait till I come.\" Mu‘adh said: \"When we reached the spring\nit used to gush forth some water. We found that two men had already preceded us to\nit. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked them: ‘Have you touched its water?",
  "’ They\nreplied: ‘Yes’. He said what Allâh inspired him to say, then he scooped up little water\nof that spring, thin stream which gathered together, he washed his face and hand\nwith it and poured it back into it; consequently plenty of water spouted out of it so\npeople watered. ‘Mu‘adh’, said the Messenger of Allâh, ‘if you were doomed to live\nlong life you will see in here fields full of vegetation.’\" \t[Sahih Muslim 2/246]\nOn the way to Tabuk, or as soon as they reached Tabuk, the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] said: ‘Severe wind will blow tonight, so none of you should stand up.\nWhoever has a camel should tie it up.’ Later on when the strong wind blew, one of\nthe men stood up and the wind carried him away to Tai’ Mountain. \t[ibid. Sahih Muslim 2/246]\nAll the way long the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was intent on the performance of the\ncombined prayer of noon and the afternoon; and so did he with sunset and evening\nprayers. His prayers for both were either pre- time or post- time prayers.\nThe Army of Islam at Tabuk\nArriving at Tabuk and camping there, the Muslim army was ready to face the enemy.\nThere, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] delivered an eloquent speech that included the\nmost inclusive words. In that speech he urged the Muslims to seek the welfare of this\nworld and the world to come. He warned and cherished them and gave them good\ntidings. By doing that he cherished those who were broken in spirits, and blocked up\nthe gap of shortage and mess they were suffering from due to lack of supplies, food\nand other substances.\nUpon learning of the Muslims’ march, the Byzantines and their allies were so terrified\nthat none of them dared set out to fight. On the contrary they scattered inside their\nterritory. It brought, in itself, a good credit to the Muslim forces. That had gained\nmilitary reputation in the mid and remote lands of Arabian Peninsula. The great and\nserious political profits that the Muslim forces had obtained, were far better than the\nones they could have acquired if the two armies had been engaged in military\nconfrontation.\nThe Head of Ailah, Yahna bin Rawbah came to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], made\npeace with him and paid him the tribute (Al- Jizya). Both of Jarba’ and Adhruh\n\n-- 276 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n277\npeoples paid him tribute, as well. So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave each a\nguarantee letter, similar to Yahna’s, in which he says:\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nThis is a guarantee of protection from Allâh and Muhammad the Prophet,\nthe Messenger of Allâh, to Yahna bin Rawbah and the people of Ailah; their\nships, their caravans on land and sea shall have the custody of Allâh and the\nProphet Muhammad, he and whosoever are with him of Ash- Sham people\nand those of the sea. Whosoever contravenes this treaty, his wealth shall\nnot save him; it shall be the fair prize of him that takes it. Now it should not\nbe lawful to hinder the men from any springs which they have been in the\nhabit of frequenting, nor from any journeys they desire to make, whether by\nsea or by land.\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dispatched Khalid bin Al- Waleed at the head of four\nhundred and fifty horsemen to ‘Ukaidir Dumat Al- Jandal and said to him: \"You will\nsee him hunting oryxes.\" So when Khalid drew near his castle and was as far as an\neye- sight range, he saw the oryxes coming out rubbing their horns against the castle\ngate. As it was a moony night Khalid could see Ukaidir come out to hunt them, so he\ncaptured him — though he was surrounded by his men — and brought him back to\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who spared his life and made peace with him for the\npayment of two thousand camels, eight hundred heads of cattle, four hundred\narmours and four hundred lances. He obliged him to recognize the duty of paying\ntribute and charged him with collecting it from Dumat, Tabuk, Ailah and Taima’.\nThe tribes, who used to ally the Byzantines, became quite certain that their\ndependence oinn their former masters came to an end. Therefore they turned into\nbeing pro- Muslims. The Islamic state had therefore enlarged its borders to an extent\nthat it, touched the Byzantines’ and their agents’ borders. So we see that the\nByzantine agents role was over.\nReturning to Madinah\nThe Muslim army returned from Tabuk victoriously, undeceived or wronged. That\nwas because Allâh had sufficed them the evils of fight.\nOn the way back and at a mountain road, twelve hypocrites sought the Prophet’s life\nand that was while he was passing along that mountain road with only Ammar\nholding the rein of his she- camel and Hudhaifa bin Al- Yaman driving it, at the time\nthat people had already gone down into the bottom of the valley.\nThe hypocrites seized that opportunity to seek the Prophet’s life. As the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] and his two companions were moving along, they heard thrusts of\npeople coming towards him from behind with their faces veiled. Hudhaifa, who was\nsent by the Prophet to see what was going on, saw them and stroke their mounts’\nfaces with a crook in his hand and Allâh cast fear into their hearts. They fled away\nand overtook their people.\n\n-- 277 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n278\nHowever, Hudhaifa named them to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and informed him\nof their intentions. So that was why Hudhaifa was called the \"confidant\" of the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh]. About this event Allâh, the Exalted says:\n\"And they resolved that (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) which\nthey were unable to carry out.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:74]\nWhen his headquarters, Madinah, began to loom at the horizon, the Prophet [pbuh]\nsaid: \"This is a cheerful sight. This is Uhud, which is a mountain, we like it and it\nlikes us.\" When the Madinese learnt of their arrival they set out to meet the army.\nWomen, youths, youngsters and small children went out of town to celebrate their\nhome- return wholeheartedly singing:\n\"The full moon shone down upon us, through the traits of Al- Wada‘\nMountain.\nThanks is due to us, as long as a supplicator invokes to Allâh..\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ’s march to Tabuk was in Rajab and his return in\nRamadan. So we see that this \tGhazwah \ttook fifty days, twenty days of which were\nspent in Tabuk and the others on the way to and fro. Tabuk Invasion was the last\none made by the Prophet [pbuh].\nThe People Who lagged Behind\nDue to its particular circumstances, this invasion was a peculiar severe trial provided\nby Allâh only to try the believers’Faith and sort them out of others. This is Allâh’s\npermanent Will in such circumstances. In this respect He says:\n\"Allâh will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He\ndistinguishes the wicked from the good.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:179]\nLagging and hanging back from full participation in that invasion amounted to the\ndegree of hypocrisy. Whenever the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was informed of a\nman’s lingering, he would say: \"Leave him alone! If Allâh knows him to be good He\nwill enable him to follow you; but if he were not so, Allâh would relieve us of him.\"\nNobody stayed behind except those who were either hindered by a serious excuse or\nthe hypocrites who told lies to Allâh and His Messenger.\nSome of those hypocrites’ lingering was due to an excuse based on forgery and\ndelusion. Some others tarried but didn’t ask for an instant permission. But there\nwere three believers who unjustifiably lingered. They were the ones whom Allâh tried\ntheir Faith, but later on He turned to them in mercy and accepted their repentance.\nAs soon as the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had entered Madinah, he prayed two \tRak‘a\nthen he sat to receive his people. The hypocrites who were over eighty men [Fath Al-\nBari 8/119] came and offered various kinds of excuses and started swearing. The\nProphet acknowledged their excuses and invoked Allâh’s forgiveness for them but he\nentrusted their inner thoughts and Faith to Allâh.\n\n-- 278 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n279\nAs for the three faithful believers — Ka‘b bin Malik, Murara bin Ar- Rabi‘, and Hilal bin\nOmaiyah — who favoured telling the truth, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] bade his\nCompanions not to talk to them.\nConsequently they were subject to a severe boycott and were excluded from the life\nof the community. Everybody turned them their back. So they felt as if the whole\nland had become constrained to them in spite of its spaciousness and they felt\nawkward and uneasy. The hard times they lived and which lasted for over forty days\nwere towered by an order to them to forsake their wives. After fifty days’ boycott\nAllâh turned to them and revealed that in Qur’ân:\n\"And (He did forgive also) the three (whom the Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æ\nÓáã) left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was\nsuspended for Allâh’s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was\nstraitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived\nthat there is no fleeing from Allâh, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He\naccepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allâh\nis the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:118]\nAllâh’s turning to them was a great joy for both Muslims and the three concerned.\nThe joy of the stayers behind was unaccountable in aim and degree. It was the\nhappiest day in their lives. The good tiding cherished them and filled their hearts\nwith delight. As for those who lingered due to disability or sickness or any other\nserious excuse, Allâh, the Exalted said about them:\n\"There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to\nspend [in holy warfare (Jihad)], if they are sincere (in duty) to Allâh and His\nMessenger.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:91]\nWhen he approached Madinah, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said:\n\"Inside Madinah, there are certain men, who though being left back due to\nserious excuses, they have, all the time, been with you. Lingerers as they\nare, they have been while you were passing valleys or walking along roads.\"\n\"Do you mean that they have done that while they are still in Madinah?\"\nThey wondered. \"Yes though they are in Madinah.\" The Prophet said.\nThe Invasion of Tabuk and its Far-Reaching Ramifications\nThe effect of this invasion is great as regards extending and confirming the Muslims’\ninfluence and domination on the Arabian Peninsula. It was quite obvious to\neverybody that no power but Islam’s would live long among the Arabs. The\nremainders of \tJahiliyin \tand hypocrites — who used to conspire steadily against the\nMuslims and who perpetually relied on Byzantine power when they were in need of\nsupport or help — these people lost their expectations and desires of ever reclaiming\ntheir ex- influence. Realizing that there was no way out and that they were to submit\nto the \tfait accompli, they gave up their attempts.\nFrom that time on, hypocrites were no longer treated leniently or even gently by the\nMuslims. Allâh not only bade Muslims to treat them severely but He also forbade\nthem to take their gift charities or perform prayer on their dead, or ask Allâh’s\n\n-- 279 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n280\nforgiveness for them or even visit their tombs. Allâh bade the Muslims to demolish\nthe mosque, which they verily appointed and used as a hiding place where they\nmight practise their plots, conspiracy and deceit. Some Qur’ânic verses were sent\ndown disclosing them publicly and utterly so that everybody in Madinah got to know\ntheir reality.\nThe great impact that this invasion produced could be perceived in of the great\nnumber of delegations who came successively to meet the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]. Naturally, deputations used to come to meet him at the end of an invasion\nparticularly after Makkah Conquest [Ibn Hisham 2/515- 537; Za'd Al- Ma'ad 3/2- 13;\nSahih Al- Bukhari 2/633,635- 637, 1/252, 414; Fath Al- Bari 8/110- 126; Mukhtasar\nSeerat Ar- Rasool p.391- 407] but they were not as many as these nor were they as\nfrequent as they were then in the wake of Tabuk event. It was certainly the greatest.\nThe Qur’ânic Verses Relating to this Invasion\nMany a verse of \tBara’a \t(Tauba) \tChapter handling the event of Tabuk were revealed.\nSome verses were revealed before the march, while others after setting out for\nTabuk, i.e. in the context of the battle. Some other verses were also revealed on the\nProphet’s arrival in Madinah. All of which covered the incidents that featured this\ninvasion: the immanent circumstances of the battle, exposure of the hypocrites, the\nprerogatives and special rank earmarked for the strivers in the cause of Allâh,\nacceptance of the repentance of the truthful believers who slackened and those who\nhung back, etc.\nSome Important Events that featured that Year\nDuring this year many events of great significance took place. They were:\n1. \tAfter the Messenger’s return from Tabuk, the sworn allegation of infidelity [In\ncase of an infidelity accusation that lacks evidence, both husband and wife\nswear by Allah that they are innocent and did not commit infidelity. The\nHusband invokes Allah's curses on himself if he is lying and the women\ninvokes Allah's wrath on her if she is lying] between ‘Uwaimir Al- ‘Ajlani and\nhis wife took place.\n2. \tPelting with stones the Ghamidiyah woman who confessed committing\nadultery. She was pelted with stones only after weaning her child off her\nbreast milk.\n3. \tNegus Ashama; the king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), died so the Prophet [pbuh]\nperformed prayer in absentia for him.\n4. \tThe death of Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Prophet [pbuh], the Prophet\nfelt extremely sad at her death. \"Had I got a third daughter, I would let you\nmarry her.\" He said to ‘Uthman.\n5. \tThe death of ‘Abdullah bin Abi Salool, the head of hypocrites, after the\nProphet’s return from Tabuk. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked Allâh’s\nforgiveness for him. He also prayed for him in spite of ‘Umar’s disapproval\nand his attempt to prevent him from doing that. Later on a Qur’ânic verse\nwas revealed attesting to ‘Umar’s right viewpoint.\n\n-- 280 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n281\nAbu Bakr [R] performs the Pilgrimage\nIn the month Dhul- Qa‘dah or in Dhul- Hijjah of the very year (the ninth of Al- Hijra),\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dispatched Abu Bakr [R], the truthful, as a deputy\nprince of \tAl- Hajj \t(pilgrimage), so that he would lead the Muslims in performing of the\npilgrimage rituals.\nSoon after the departure of the Muslims, there came a Revelation from Allâh: the\nopening passages of the Chapter 9 entitled ‘Repentance’ (Surah Tauba \tor \tBara’a) in\nwhich ‘freedom from obligation’ is proclaimed from Allâh in regard to those idolatrous\ntribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with\nthe Prophet [pbuh]. Communication of this news went in line with the Arabian\ntraditions of making public any change relating to declining conventions of blood and\nfortunes.\n‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed to make this declaration. He overtook Abu Bakr at Al-\n‘Arj or Dajnan. Abu Bakr inquired whether the Prophet [pbuh] had put him in\ncommand or he had just been commissioned to make the announcement. \"I have\nbeen deputed to make the proclamation only\" replied ‘Ali. The two Companions then\nproceeded with the pilgrimage process. Towards the close of the rituals, on the day\nof the ritual sacrifice, ‘Ali stood at \tAl- Jamrah \t(a spot at which stones are pelted) and\nread aloud to the multitudes that thronged around him and declared quittance from\ncovenants with idolaters and giving them four months’ respite to reconsider their\nposition. As for the other idolaters with whom the believers had a treaty and had\nabated nothing of the Muslims’ rights nor had supported anyone against them, then\nthe terms of the treaty would run valid until the duration of which expired.\nAbu Bakr then sent some Muslims to declare publicly that no disbeliever would after\nthat year perform pilgrimage, nor would anyone be allowed to make the \tTawaf\n(going round) of the Sacred House unclothed.\nThat proclamation in fact vetoed all aspects of paganism out of Arabia and stated\nquite unequivocally that those pre- Islam practices were no longer in operation. [Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/220, 415, 2/626,671; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/25,26; Ibn Hisham 2/543-546]\n\n-- 281 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n282\nA Meditation on the Ghazawat\nMeditation on the Prophet’s \tGhazawat, missions, and the battalions he formed and\ndispatched, will certainly give us and everybody a true and clear impression that the\nProphet [pbuh] was the greatest military leader in the whole world as well as the\nmost righteous, the most insightful and the most alert one. He was not a man of\nsuperior genius for this concern but he was also the Master and the greatest of all\nMessengers as far as Prophethood and Heavenly Message are concerned. Besides, all\nthe battles that he had fought were standard in their application to the requirements\nof strictness, bravery, and good arrangements that fitted the terms and conditions of\nwar. None of the battles he fought was lost as a consequence of shortage of wisdom\nor due to any other technical error in army mobilization or a location in a wrong\nstrategical position. The loss of any of his battle was not due to misjudgement about\noccupying the best and the most appropriate sites of battles, nor was it due to a\nmischoice of leaders of the fight, for he had proved himself to be a peculiar sort of\nleader that differs from any of those leaders that our world had known and\nexperienced. As regards Uhud and Hunain events, there were consequences of\nweakness in some military elements in Hunain; and disobedience to orders in Uhud.\nTheir non- compliance with wisdom and the plan of the battle played a passive role in\nthe course of those two invasions.\nHis genius was clearly shown in these two battles when the Muslims were defeated;\nfor he stoodfast facing the enemy and managed, by his super wisdom, to thwart the\nenemy’s aim as was the case in Uhud. Similarly he managed to change the Muslims’\ndefeat in Hunain into a victory. Nothwithstanding the fact that serious grave\ndevelopments in military operations usually leave the worst impression on the\nmilitary leaders and entice them to flee for their lives.\nWe have, so far, discussed the mere aspects of military leadership of the invasions.\nOn the other hand, through these invasions he was able to impose security, institute\npeace, diffuse dissension and destroy the military might of the enemies through\nrelentless struggle between Islam and paganism.\nThe Prophet had also profound insight and could differentiate the faithful from the\nhypocrites and plotters.\nGreat was the group of military leaders who fought and excelled the Persians and the\nByzantines in the battlefields of Ash- Sham and Iraq with respect to war strategy and\nleading the fight procedures. The very leaders, who succeeded Muhammad [pbuh] ,\nmanaged to drive off the enemies of Islam, from their lands and countries, their\ngardens and springs, and their farms. They drove them off their honourable\nresidence and from the grace and provisions they owned and enjoyed. Those Muslim\nleaders were all Muhammad’s men. They were imbued with the spirit of Islam at the\nhand of the Prophet [pbuh].\nThanks to these battles, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] managed accommodation,\nsecured land and provided chances of work for all Muslims. He, even, made a lot of\ninquiries about the refugee problems who (then) had no houses or fortunes. He\nequipped the army with weapons, horses and expenditures. He had all that realized\nwithout exercising a particle weight of injustice. The Prophet [pbuh] has altered the\nstandards and aims of pre- Islamic wars. Their war was no more than robbing, killing,\nplundering, tyranny and aggression- oriented wars. Those wars focused on winning\n\n-- 282 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n283\nvictory, oppressing the weakling and demolishing their houses and constructions. For\nthem, war was a means by which they can rape or unveil women, practise cruelty\nagainst the weakling, the babies and small children, spoil tillage and race, and\nspread corruption on the earth. Islamic wars are different from pre- Islamic wars. A\n\"war\" in Islam is a \tJihad. That is to say it is a noble sacred fight in the way of Allâh\nfor the verification of a Muslim society that seeks to free man from oppression,\ntyranny and aggression. It is a society that everyone everywhere and at all times\nshould be proud of.Pre- Islamic thoughts and traditions of \tAl- Jahiliyah \tperiod have\nbeen turned upside down by Islam. These were so hard upon the weakling that they\nhad to invoke Allâh to enable them to get away from that pre- Islamic environment\nby saying:\n\"Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise\nfor us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will\nhelp.\"\nThe war of corruption, slaying and robbing that used to prevail has now turned into a\nsacred one, \tAl- Jihad. One of the greatest aims of \tAl- Jihad \tis to free man from the\naggression, the oppression and the tyranny of men of power. A man of power, in\nIslam, is a weakling till after the right of the poor is taken from him. War, in Islam, is\na \tJihad \tfor the purification of the land of Allâh from deception, treachery, sinful\ndeeds and aggression. It is a sacred war that aims at spreading security, safety,\nmercy and compassion as well as observing the rights and magnanimity. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] had issued honourable strict rules about war and bade his\nsoldiers and leaders to comply with them. They were forbidden to break those rules\nunder any circumstances. In reference to Sulaiman bin Buraidah’s version, who said\nthat his father had told him that whenever the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] appointed\na leader on an army or on a battalion, he used to recommend him to fear Allâh, the\nGreat and All- Mighty, when dealing with those who were closest to him and to be\ngood with all Muslims. Then the Prophet [pbuh] would say to him:\n\"Let your invasion be in the Name of Allâh and for His sake. Fight those who\ndisbelieve in Allâh. Invade but do not exaggerate nor commit treachery.\nNever deform the corpse of a dead person or kill an infant child.\"\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked people to facilitate but he forbade them to bear\ndown hard on others or constrain. \"Pacify\", he said, \"and do not disincline\". [Sahih\nMuslim 2/82,83] When it happened that he arrived at the battlefield by night, he\nwould never invade the enemy till it was morning. He utterly forbade burning (i.e.\ntorturing people) in fire, killing children and women or even beating them. He also\nforbade theft and robbery and proceeded so far as to say gains acquired through\nplundering are not less forbidden than the flesh of a corpse. Corruption of tillage and\nrace and cutting down of trees were all forbidden unless they were badly needed and\nthere was no other substitute:\n\"Do not kill a wounded person nor run after a fleeing one or kill a captive.\"\nHe decreed that envoys cannot be killed. He also stressed on not killing those who\nmade covenants. He even said:\n\n-- 283 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n284\n\"He whoever kills one who is under pledge to a covenant shall not smell\nParadise, though its smell could be experienced at a forty- year distance\nfrom it.\"\nThere were some other noble rules which purified wars from their \tAl- Jahiliyah \t(pre-\nIslamic) filthiness and turned them into sacred wars. [Za'd Al- Ma'ad 2/64- 68; and for\ndetails Jihad in Islam p.216- 262]\n\n-- 284 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n285\nPeople embrace the Religion of Allâh in Large Crowds\nThe invasion and the conquest of Makkah was — as we have already stated — a\ndecisive battle that destroyed paganism utterly. The Arabs as a result of that battle\nwere able to differentiate the truth from the error. Delusion no longer existed in their\nlife. So they raced to embrace Islam. ‘Amr bin Salamah said: \"We were at a water\n(spring) where the passage of people was. So when camel riders passed by us we\nused to ask them: ‘What is the matter with people? What is this man (i.e. the\nProphet) like?’ They would say, ‘He claims that Allâh has revealed so and so.’ I used\nto memorize those words as if they had been recited within my chest. The Arabs\nused to ascribe their Islamization to the conquest. They would say: ‘Leave him alone\nto face his people. If he were a truthful Prophet he would overcome them.’ So when\nthe conquest took place, peoples hastened to declare their Islam. My father was the\nquickest of all my people to embrace Islam. Arriving at his people he said: ‘By Allâh I\nhave just verily been to the Prophet [pbuh]. And he said: ‘Perform so a prayer at\nsuch a time, and so and so prayers at such and such time. When the prayer time is\ndue let one of you call for the prayer and appoint the most learned of the Qur’ân\namong you to be an \tImam \t(leader) of yours. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/615,616]\" This\nProphetic tradition manifests the great effect of the conquest of Makkah on the phase\nof events. It certainly shows the influence of the conquest of Makkah upon the\nconsolidation of Islam as well as on the Arabs’ stand and their surrender to Islam.\nThat influence was absolutely confirmed and deeply rooted after the invasion of\nTabuk. A clear and an obvious evidence of that influence could be deduced from the\ngreat number of delegations arriving in Madinah successively in the ninth and tenth\nyears of Al- Hijra. The immense crowds of people who raced to embrace the religion\nof Allâh and the great army which included ten thousand fighters in the invasion of\nthe conquest of Makkah had grown big enough to include thirty thousand fighters\nsharing in Tabuk invasion. It was only in less than a year after the conquest of\nMakkah that this growth in Islamic army had taken place. A hundred thousand or a\nhundred and forty four thousand Muslim pilgrims shared in \tHajjatul \t- Wada‘ \t(i.e.\nFarewell Pilgrimage); it was such an enormous number of Muslims surging — as an\nocean of men — round the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], that the horizon echoed their\nvoices and the expanses of land shook whereby while saying \tLabbaik \t(i.e. Lord, here\nwe are worshipping), glorifying and magnifying Allâh, and thanking Him.\n\n-- 285 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n286\nThe Delegations\nThe number of delegations listed in \tAhl Al- Maghazi \twere over seventy. Investigating\nsuch a large number is not an accessible thing; besides stating them in detail is not\nof a great benefit. Therefore, I am going to reveal an expose about what is\nhistorically wonderful or highly significant. Anyway a reader should always keep in\nmind that whilst the majority of tribes arrived in Madinah after the conquest, there\nwere also pre- conquest delegations.\n1. \tThe delegation of ‘Abdul Qais: \tThis tribe had two arrivals. The first was in\nthe fifth year of Al- Hijra or before that date. Munqidh bin Haiyan, a member\nof that tribe, used to trade in Madinah. So, as soon as he heard of Islam when\nhe had arrived in it for trading — that was after the migration — he embraced\nIslam and carried a pledge from the Prophet [pbuh] to his people who\neventually became Muslims too. Thirteen or fourteen of them came to the\nProphet [pbuh] in one of the \tHurum \tMonths. It was then that they asked the\nProphet’s advice about the Faith and drinks. Their chief was Al- Ashaj Al- Usri,\nto whom the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"You have two qualities that\nAllâh likes: They are deliberatenessandclemency.\"\nTheir second arrival was in the Year of Delegations. They were forty men. Al-\nJarud bin Al- ‘Alâ’ Al- ‘Abdi, who was Christian but turned to be a good Muslim,\nwas one of that group. \t[Explanation of Sahih Muslim by An-Nawawi 1/33; Fath Al-Bari 8/85,86]\n2. \tDaws Delegation: \tThe arrival of this tribe was in the early times of the\nseventh year and that was when the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was in\nKhaibar. At- Tufail bin ‘Amr Ad- Dawsi, that we have already talked about and\nexplained how he became a Muslim at the time the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nwas in Makkah. He went back home to his people where he kept calling\npeople to Islam but they tarried till he despaired of them and returned to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] and asked him to invoke Allâh against Daws but\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] invoked Allâh to guide Daws. Later on, Daws\nembraced Islam. So At- Tufail arrived in Madinah accompanied by seventy or\neighty families of his people in the early times of the seventh year of Al- Hijra,\nat the time that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was at Khaibar, so he overtook\nhim there.\n3. \tFarwah Bani ‘Amr Al- Judhami’s messenger: \tFarwah was an Arab leader\nin the Byzantine army. He was a Byzantine agent ruler by proxy on the Arabs\nallied to the Byzantines. His home was at Mu‘an and the surrounding area of\nAsh- Sham lands. Seeing the stamina and courage of the Muslims he became\na Muslim. The battle of Mu’tah — which took place in the eighth year of Al-\nHijra — compelled his admiration. He sent a white mule gift with a messenger\nof his to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to inform him of his conversion into\nIslam. When the Byzantines learnt of his embracing Islam, they sent him to\nprison. At first they gave him an opportunity to choose one of the two —\n\"either he defects from Islam or death shall be his punishment.\" Refusing to\ndefect they crucified him and cut his neck at a water (fountain) called ‘Afra’ in\nPalestine. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/45; Tafheem-ul-Qur'an 2/169]\n4. \tSudâ’ Delegation: \tThe arrival of this delegation was after the departure of\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] from Al- Ji‘ranah in the eighth year of Al- Hijra.\nIt was because the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had already dispatched a\n\n-- 286 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n287\nmission that comprised four hundred Muslims and asked them to go to where\nSudâ’ was. Sudâ’ was (a fresh- water fountain) in Yemen. While the mission\nwas camping there at the starting point of a canal. Ziyad bin Al- Harith As-\nSudâ’i learned of their stay, so he came to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and\nsaid: \"I have come to you as a deputy of my people, so tell your army to go\nback and I guarantee of my peo",
  "ple.\" The army were sent away off the canal.\nIn his turn As- Sudâ’i went back, cherished and urged his people to come and\nmeet the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Eventually fifteen of them came and\npledged allegiance to him as true Muslims. Returning home, they in their turn,\nurged the rest to be Muslims. Thus Islam spread among them. Later on, a\nhundred men joined the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] in \tHajjatul- \tWada‘\n(Farewell Pilgrimage.)\n5. \tThe arrival of Ka‘b bin Zuhair bin Abi Sulma: \tKa‘b who was a member of\na family of poets, was considered one of the most poetic Arab poets. He used\nto satirize the Prophet [pbuh] when he wasn’t a Muslim. In the eighth year of\nAl- Hijra and at the time that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had already gone\nback from At- Ta’if invasion, Bujair bin Zuhair wrote a letter to his brother Ka‘b\nwarning and advising him: \"The Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh]) had killed some\nmen in Makkah who used to satirize and harm him, and that the other poets\nwho had survived fled in all directions for their lives. So if you want to save\nyour skin, hasten to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. He never kills those who\nresort to him as repentant. If you refuse to do as I tell, it is up to you to try\nto save your skin by any means.\" The two brothers corresponded with one\nanother for a long time till Ka‘b was awkward and felt as if the earth had\nconstrained on him. Arriving in Madinah, he stayed at a man’s house from\nJuhainah as a guest. They performed the dawn prayer together; but when he\nwas about to leave, the man suggested that he go to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]. He went there, sat by him, put his hand in his. The Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] who had never seen Ka‘b before, did not recognize him. Ka‘b\nthen said: \"O, Messenger of Allâh! Ka‘b bin Zuhair has come to you as a\nrepentant Muslim; will he be secure and forgiven if I fetch him?\" The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] said, \"Yes.\" \"I am Ka‘b bin Zuhair,\" said he. Upon\nhearing that one of the Helpers rose to his feet and asked the Messenger’s\nallowance to cut his throat. \"Leave him alone!\" Said the Prophet [pbuh], \"He\nhas become a repentant Muslim after his disposal of the past.\" Ka‘b then\nrecited his well- known poem \"Su‘ad appeared...\" \tin which he praised the\nProphet [pbuh], thanked him and apologized for the wrongs he had done. He\nacknowledged Muhammad’s mission. Both Emigrants and Helpers were\nspoken of in this poem but differently. He praised the Emigrants but criticized\nthe Helpers, for one of them demanded a Prophet’s permission to kill him.\nLater on Ka‘b tried to compensate for that by praising the Helpers too but that\nwas in another poem.\n6. \t‘Udharah Delegation: \tThis delegation which consisted of twelve men, had\narrived in Madinah in Safar, the ninth year of Al- Hijra. They spent three days\nthere. One of them was Hamza bin An- Nu‘man. When they were asked who\nthey were, they said \"We are Bani ‘Udharah, the foster brothers of Qusai to\nhis mother. We are the ones who supported Qusai, and removed Khuza’a and\nBani Bakr from the bosom of Makkah. We have relatives and kinspeople.\" So\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] welcomed them and gave good tidings to\nthem, which was Ash- Sham Conquest; but he, on the other hand, forbade\nthem from consulting a soothsayer and from eating the slain animals they\n\n-- 287 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n288\nslaughtered. Eventually they became Muslims, stayed there for several days\nthen went back.\n7. \tBali Delegation: \tTheir arrival was in Rabi‘ Al- Awwal, the ninth year of Al-\nHijra. They embraced Islam, stayed in Madinah for three days. Their chief Abu\nAd- Dabeeb wondered whether hospitality was rewarded by Allâh. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] said:\n\"Yes, and so is any charity you offer to poor or rich people that is\nSadaqah.\"\nHe also inquired about the time allotted to hospitality. \"Three days,\" said he.\n\"What about the stray ewe?\" The Prophet said: \"It is either yours or your\nbrother’s, otherwise it goes to the wolf.\" He inquired about the stray camel.\n\"It is not of your business. Leave it alone! Its owner will try to find it.\"\n8. \tThaqif Delegation: \tTheir arrival was in Ramadan, the ninth year of Al- Hijra,\nafter the return of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] from Tabuk. As to how they\nbecame Muslims, this could be deduced from the following:\nTheir chief ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Ath- Thaqafi came to see the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] after the latter’s return from At- Ta’if in Dhul- Qa‘dah in the year 8 A.H.\n‘Urwah became a Muslim. He thought that when he will tell his people and call\nthem to embrace Islam, they would obey him, because he had always been\nan obeyed Master. He was even more beloved to them than their own\nfirstborn. But contrary to that, when he called them to Islam they shot arrows\nat him from everywhere and killed him. They remained as they were for\nmonths before they started discussing the situation again among themselves.\nUpon realizing that they were incapable of fighting the neighbouring Arabs\nwho had paid allegiance to the Prophet [pbuh] and converted to Islam, they\nmade up their mind to dispatch a man to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. They\nconcluded that ‘Abd Yalail bin ‘Amr would be the right messenger.\n‘Abd refused to do such a thing lest they should kill him as they had killed\n‘Urwah. \"I will not do such a thing till you send some other men with me,\"\nsaid ‘Abd. So they sent two men of their allies and three others from Bani\nMalik. The six of them including ‘Uthman bin Abi Al- ‘As Ath- Thaqafi who was\nthe youngest among them all.\nWhen they entered into the Prophet’s [pbuh] audience, a tent was pitched up\nin a corner of the mosque so that they might listen to the Qur’ân and see\npeople at prayer. During their stay they came again and again to the Prophet\n[pbuh] who kept on calling them to embrace Islam, till their chief asked the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] to enter into a peace treaty between him and\nThaqif by means of which he allows them to commit fornication, drink wine\nand deal with usury. They also asked him not to injure their tyrant idol \"Al-\nLat\" or to oblige them to perform the prayer. Finally they insisted that they\nwould not knock down the idols themselves. But the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh]turned down all their requests. They went aside to council. Realizing\nthat there were no other alternatives they yielded and professed Islam. The\nonly condition that they insisted on was that the demolition of Al- Lat should\nbe dealt with and handled by the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] whereas Thaqif\n\n-- 288 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n289\nshould in no way knock it down themselves. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nagreed and took a pledge with them.\nBeing the most attentive and the keenest to study jurisprudence and learn\nQur’ân, ‘Uthman bin Abi Al- ‘As was appointed by the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] a prince on his people. His keenness and carefulness to learn the\nQur’ân and study jurisprudence were clearly discernible through his behaviour\nduring their stay.\nEveryday morning, the group of delegates used to go and see the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh]. Being the youngest one, ‘Uthman bin Abi Al- ‘As was left\nbehind with their camels and things to keep an eye on. At noon when they\ncame back and slept, ‘Uthman used to go to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]in\norder to learn the Qur’ân and inquire about religious matters. If it happened\nthat the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was asleep, he would then go to Abu Bakr\nfor the same purpose. With the passage of time, he turned out to be a source\nof blessing to his people. For at the Apostasy Times (Ar- Riddah) when Thaqif\nwere determined to apostatize, he addressed them saying: \"O, folkmen of\nThaqif! You have been the latest at embracing Islam, so do not be the first to\napostatize.\" Consequently they gave up apostasy and clung fast to Islam.\nThe group of delegates returned home but they were determined to conceal\nthe truth for a while. They told their people to expect fight at any moment.\nThey pretended to be grieved and depressed. They claimed that the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] demanded that they should embrace Islam and\nabandon adultery, drinking wine and dealing with usury and some other\nthings, or else he would fight them. Seized by the arrogance and zeal of \tAl-\nJahiliyah \t(pre- Islamic traditions), Thaqif remained for days intent on fighting.\nThen Allâh cast terror and dismay in their hearts in such a way that they gave\nup fighting and thought that the delegation should go back to him and\nannounce their approval. It was until then that the group of delegates told\nthem the truth and revealed the items of their peace- talk with the Prophet,\nconsequently Thaqif embraced Islam.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent some men to demolish the idol called \"Al-\nLat\" under the command of Khalid bin Al- Waleed. Al- Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah,\nstood to his feet, held the hoe and the ax and said: \"By Allâh, I will make you\nlaugh at Thaqif.\" He struck with them, and pretended to fall down while\nrunning. The people of Thaqif trembled at that sight and said: \"May Allâh\ndismay Al- Mugheerah off. The goddess has killed him.\" Hearing that Al-\nMugheerah leapt up to his feet and said: \"May Allâh bring shame on you. Al-\nLat is nothing but a mass of dirt and stones.\" Then he struck the door and\nbroke it. He mounted its highest wall, and so did the other men. They\nknocked Al- Lat down till they levelled it with the ground. Then they dug up its\nfoundation and brought out its jewels and garments; to the great\nastonishment of Thaqif. Khalid bin Al- Waleed and his group came back to the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] carrying Al- Lat’s jewels and garments. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] distributed them and thanked Allâh for helping his\nProphet and solidifying his religion. \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/26-28; Ibn Hisham 3/537-542]\n9. \tThe message of the Yemeni kings: \tAfter the return of the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] from Tabuk, a message came to him from the kings of Himyar,\n\n-- 289 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n290\nAl- Harith bin ‘Abd Kilal, Na‘eem bin ‘Abd Kilal, An- Nu‘man bin Qeel Dhi Ra‘in,\nHamdan and Mu‘afir. Their messenger was Malik bin Murrah Ar- Rahawi. They\nsent him in order to inform the Prophet [pbuh] about their embracing Islam\nand their parting with polytheism. In reply to their message, the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] gave them the pledge of Allâh and the pledge of His Messenger\nprovided they paid the tribute, which was still overdue. He sent to them some\nof his Companions under the command of Mu‘adh bin Jabal [R].\n10. \tHamdan Delegation: \tThe arrival of this delegation was in the ninth\nyear of Al- Hijra after the Messenger’s return from Tabuk. So the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] gave them a pledge to guarantee the fulfillment of their\ndemands. He sent to them Malik bin An- Namt as their chief, and appointed\nhim as an agent on those of his people who embraced Islam. Khalid bin Al-\nWaleed was appointed for them all with a purpose of calling them to Islam.\nHe stayed with them for six months calling them to Islam but no one\nresponded to his call. Later on ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was dispatched there and\nKhalid was ordered to come back. Upon arriving at Hamdan, ‘Ali\ncommunicated to them a message from the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and\ncalled them to Islam. They responded to the call and became Muslims. ‘Ali\nwrote to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] informing him of the good tidings. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] was briefed on the content of that letter, so he\nprostrated, then raised his head up and said: \"Peace be upon Hamdan. Peace\nbe upon Hamdan.\"\n11. \tThe Delegation of Bani Fazarah: \tUpon the Messenger’s return from\nTabuk, the delegation of Bani Fazarah came to see him. That was in the ninth\nyear of Al- Hijra. The group of delegates were over ten men. They came in\norder to profess Islam and complain about the drought of their region. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] ascended the pulpit, lifted his hands up and\nimplored Allâh to send rain forth onto them and said:\n\"O Allâh let rain fall down, and water Your country and animals, and\nspread Your mercy and bring to life the dead lands. O Allâh send rain\nthat would be saving, comforting, and sprouting grass, and\noverwhelming vast areas sooner and later. Let it be useful rain and\nnot harmful. O Allâh let it be rain of mercy and not rain of torture and\nchastisement. Let that rain not be destructive or floody. O Allâh send\nus down water and help to fight the enemies.\" \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/48]\n12. \tNajran’s Delegation: \tNajran is rather a big area of land. It was at a\ndistance of seven trip stages southwards of Makkah towards Yemen. It\nincluded seventy three villages. It took a fast- rider one day ride to get there.\n[Fath Al- Bari 8/94] Its military forces consisted of a hundred thousand\nfighters.\nTheir arrival was in the year 9 A.H. The delegation comprised sixty men.\nTwenty- four of them were of noble families. Three out of twenty- four were at\none time leaders of Najran. \tAl- ‘Aqib, i.e. who was in charge of princehood and\ngovernment affairs. His name was ‘Abdul Maseeh. The second was \tAs- Saiyid\n(the Master) under whose supervision were the educational and political\naffairs; his name was Al- Aiham or Sharhabeel. Abu Haritha bin ‘Alqamah was\nthe third. He was a bishop to whom all religious presidency and spiritual\nleadership belonged and were his charge.\n\n-- 290 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n291\nWhen that group of delegates arrived in Madinah, they met the Prophet\n[pbuh], exchanged inquiries with him; but when he called them to Islam and\nrecited the Qur’ân to them, they refused. They asked him what he thought\nabout ‘Isa (i.e. Jesus), [AWS], he [pbuh] tarried a whole day till the following\nQur’ânic reply was revealed to him:\n\"Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allâh is the likeness of Adam. He\ncreated him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was.\n(This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt. Then\nwhoever disputes with you concerning him (Jesus) after (all this)\nknowledge that has come to you, (i.e. Jesus being a slave of Allâh,\nand having no share in Divinity) say: (O Muhammad [pbuh]) ‘Come,\nlet us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women,\nourselves and yourselves — then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the\nCurse of Allâh upon those who lie.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:59- 61]\nWhen it was morning, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told them what ‘Iesa\n(Jesus) was in the light of the recently revealed verses. He left them a whole\nday to consult and think it over. So when it was next morning and they still\nshowed disapproval to admit Allâh’s Words about ‘Isa or to embrace Islam,\nthe Prophet suggested \tAl- Mubahala \tthat is each party should supplicate and\nimplore Allâh to send His Curse upon him or them if they were telling lies.\nAfter that suggestion of his, the Prophet [pbuh] came forward wrapping Al-\nHasan and Al- Husain under his garment whereas Fatimah was walking at his\nback. Seeing that the Prophet [pbuh] was serious and prepared to face them\nfirmly, they went aside and started consulting. \tAl- ‘Aqib \tand \tAs- Saiyid \t(i.e. the\nMaster) said to each other: \"We shall not supplicate. For, I swear by Allâh, if\nhe is really a Prophet and exchanges curses with us, we will never prosper\nnor will the descendants of ours. Consequently neither us nor our animals will\nsurvive it.\" Finally they made their mind to resort to the Messenger of Allâh’s\njudgement about their cause. They came to him and said: \"We grant you\nwhat you have demanded.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then admitted that\nagreement and ordered them to pay \tAl- Jizya \t(i.e. tribute) and he made peace\nwith them for the provision of two thousand garments, one thousand of them\nto be delivered in Rajab, the other thousand ones in Safar. With every\ngarment they had to pay an ounce (of gold). In return they will have the\ncovenant of Allâh and His Messenger. He gave them a covenant that provides\nfor practicing their religious affairs freely. They asked the Prophet [pbuh] to\nappoint a trustworthy man to receive the money agreed on for peace, so he\nsent them the trustworthy man of this nation \tAbu ‘Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah to\nreceive the amounts of money agreed on in the peace treaty.\nBy the time Islam started to spread in Najran, naturally, they did not have to\npay \tAl- Jizya \tthat usually non- Muslims paid. Whatever the case was, it was\nsaid that \tAl- Aqib \tand \tAs- Saiyid \tembraced Islam as soon as they reached\nNajran on their journey back home. It is also said that the Prophet [pbuh]\nsent to them ‘Ali too, for the collection of charities and tribute. \t[Fath Al-Bari 8/94, 95;\nZa'd Al-Ma'ad 3/38-40]\n13. \tBani Haneefa Delegation: \tThey arrived in Madinah in the ninth year\nof Al- Hijra. They were 17 in number and included the Master of Liars,\nMusailima [Fath Al- Bari 8/87] bin Thumamah bin Kabeer bin Habeeb bin Al-\n\n-- 291 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n292\nHarith of Bani Haneefa The group of delegates were housed in a Helper’s\nhouse. They came to the Prophet [pbuh] and declared their Islamization. As\nfor Musailima the liar, versions vary concerning his embracing Islam.\nContemplation of all these versions shows clearly that Musailima expressed\ndisapproval and revealed haughtiness, boastful spirit and expectations to be a\nprince.\nAt first the Prophet [pbuh] attempted going on well with him. he dealt with\nhim nicely and charitably but that did not do with him. The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] perceived evil in his soul and recognized that he was one of those\nthree evils he dreamt of while asleep.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] had already dreamt that he had been granted the\ntreasures of earth. His hand fell upon two golden bracelets, which distressed\nand worried him a lot. He was taught by inspiration to blow them off, so he\ndid that and they were gone off. They were interpreted to be two liars who\nwould turn up after the death of Muhammad [pbuh]. So when Musailima\nacted that way and showed disapproval, he realized that he would be one of\nthe two liars. However Musailima used to say, \"If Muhammad appointed me a\nsuccessor of his, I would be a Muslim. Later on the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\ncame to him, with a piece of palm leaf in his hand, and in the company of his\norator, Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas. He was among some of his friends. The\nProphet [pbuh] talked to him but Musailima addressed him saying: \"If you\nagree to transfer the whole thing to me after your death, I will not stand in\nyour way.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] replied: \"If you asked me to give\nyou this (i.e. a piece of a palm leaf), I would not grant it to you. You are\ndoomed. Even if you repented and stopped what you were doing, Allâh\nappointed that you would be slain. By Allâh, I swear, that I see you now in\nthe very state that has been revealed to me. Here is Thabit! You will hear my\nanswer (from him).\" Then he went away. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/627, 628; Fath\nAl- Bari 8/87- 93]\nFinally, the Prophet’s predictions of Musailima came true; for when Musailima\nreturned to Yamama, he kept on thinking about the Prophet [pbuh] and how\nhe would be his partner. His dreams and thoughts went so far as to claim that\nhe himself was a prophet. To confirm his prophecy he started uttering rhymed\nstatements. He said that it was lawful to drink wine and commit adultery. He,\nhowever, bore witness that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]was a real Prophet.\nHis people, who were fascinated by what he allowed them to do, followed him\nand made bargains with him. He grew so prominent among them that they\ncalled him the beneficent of Al- Yamama. He wrote to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] saying: \"I have been appointed an associate with you, so I will have a\nhalf and Quraish will have the other half of the people’s affairs.\" The\nMessenger of Allâh’s reply was a letter saying that:\n\"Verily, the earth is Allâh’s. He gives it as a heritage to whom He will\nof His slaves, and the (blessed) end is for the \tMuttaqûn \t(pious).\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 7:128] \t[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/31,32]\nOn the authority of Ibn Mas‘ud, he says: When the two messengers of\nMusailima — Ibn An- Nawaha and Ibn Athal — came to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh], he asked them: \"Do you bear witness that I am the Messenger of\n\n-- 292 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n293\nAllâh?\" Their reply was \"We testify that Musailima is the Messenger of Allâh.\"\n\"I believe in Allâh and in His Messenger,\" said the Prophet [pbuh], \"If I had\never thought of killing a messenger I would have killed you both.\" \t[Mishkat Al-\nMasabeeh 2/347]\nMusailima’s pretence to prophethood was in the tenth year of Al- Hijra. But he\nwas killed in Al- Yamama war during Abu Bakr As- Siddeeq era, in Rabi‘ Al-\nAwwal, in the twelfth year of Al- Hijra. He was killed by Wahshi, the killer of\nHamzah. The second person who claimed to be a prophet was Al- Aswad Al-\n‘Ansi who was in Yemen. He was killed by Fairuz. His head was cut off a day\nand a night before the Prophet’s death. So when the delegates came he told\nthem the news that reached him through Divine Revelation. News about his\ndeath reached Abu Bakr [R] from Yemen. \t[Fath Al-Bari 8/93]\n14. \tThe Delegation of Bani ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a: \tAmong the group of\ndelegates were ‘Amir bin At- Tufail — the enemy of Allâh, Arbad bin Qais —\nLabid’s maternal brother, Khalid bin Ja‘far, and Jabbar bin Aslam. All of them\nwere the leaders and satans of their people. ‘Amir was the one who double-\ncrossed the group of Ma‘una well. When this delegation made their mind to\ncome to Madinah, ‘Amir and Arbad conspired to kill the Prophet [pbuh]. So\nwhen the group of delegates arrived, ‘Amir kept on talking to the Prophet\n[pbuh] whereas Arbad turned aside trying to draw his sword. He managed to\ndraw a span of hand long but Allâh stilled his hand so that he was unable to\nproceed with its withdrawal. Allâh protected the Prophet [pbuh]. The Prophet\n[pbuh] invoked Allâh against them. So when they returned, Allâh sent down a\nthunderbolt unto Arbad and his camel and he was burnt. As for ‘Amir he\ncalled at a house of a woman who was from Bani Salul and had a gland sore.\nHe eventually died while he was saying: \"What am I like? I have a gland\nsimilar to a camel’s. And here I am dying in the house of the woman from\nBani Salul.\"\nIn \tSahih Al- Bukhari \tit is narrated that ‘Amir came to the Prophet [pbuh] and\nsaid: \"I grant you an opportunity to choose one of two: you will have the flat\nland people and I will have townspeople; or I will succeed you. Otherwise, I\nwill invade your people with a thousand he- camels and a thousand she-\ncamels.\" But, later on he got plague- stricken in a woman’s house. So he said:\n\"What! I have a gland similar to a camel’s, and here I am in a woman’s house\nof Bani so and so people. Fetch me my mare!\" He mounted it but died on its\nback.\n15. \tTujeeb Delegation: \tThey came to Madinah carrying the surplus of\ncharities (Sadaqat) \tof their people. That is to say the extra charities they had\nafter they had distributed the poor- due. They were thirteen men. They asked\nabout the Qur’ân and \tSunnah \t(the Prophet’s saying, deeds and sanctions) so\nthat they might learn them. They demanded things from the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] to which he gave them pledges. They did not stay long; so when\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] acknowledged their demands and allowed them\nto depart, they sent him a boy whom they had already left at their property.\nThe young man said to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"By Allâh, I swear, I have left my\nhome (for Madinah) with a purpose that you invoke Allâh, the Great and All-\nMighty for me to forgive me and have mercy on me and to make my heart a\n\n-- 293 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n294\nsource of content and sufficiency.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] supplicated\nAllâh to grant him what he demanded.\nFrom that time on, he was the most contented person. In \tAr- Riddah \t(i.e. the\nApostasy Times), he stoodfast as a Muslim and warned his people and\nreminded them of Allâh and went on preaching them till they stoodfast and\ndid not apostatize. The group of delegates met the Prophet [pbuh] again in\nthe Farewell Pilgrimage in the tenth year of Al- Hijra.\n16. \tTai’ Delegation: \tOne of that group of delegates who came to meet\nthe Prophet [pbuh] was Zaid Al- Khail. They talked to the Prophet [pbuh] who\nurged them to embrace Islam. They agreed and grew good Muslims. About\nZaid, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"The Arabs are never exact at\nestimating people. They have never told me about the virtues of a man\ncorrectly; for when I see the man concerned I realize that they have\noverestimated him except Zaid Al- Khail, when I met him I knew that they had\nunderestimated him.\" Then he named him ‘Zaid Al- Khair’ (i.e. Zaid, the\nbounteous).\nThe delegations arrived successively in Madinah during the ninth and tenth of Al-\nHijra. Biographers and invasion- writers have written down about some of Yemen\ndelegations. They were Al- Azd; Bani Sa‘d Hadheem from Quda‘ah, Bani ‘Amir bin\nQais; Bani Asad, Bahra’, Khaulan, Muharib, Bani Al- Harith bin Ka‘b, Ghamid, Bani Al-\nMuntafiq, Salaman, Bani ‘Abs, Muzainah, Murad, Zabid, Kinda, Dhi Murrah, Ghassan,\nBani ‘Aish, and Nakh‘ which were the last group of delegates. Nakh‘ Delegation\ncomprised two hundred men and they arrived in the middle of Muharram in the\neleventh year of Al- Hijra. The majority of these groups of delegates arrived during\nthe ninth and tenth years of Al- Hijra. The arrival of some of them tarried till the\neleventh year of Al- Hijra.\nThe succession of these delegations indicated the great degree of the entire\nacceptance which the Islamic Call reached. It manifested its influence and\ndomination on vast areas of Arabia . The Arabs observed Al- Madinah with such a\ngreat respect and estimation that they could do nothing but surrender and submit to\nit. Al- Madinah had become the headquarters of all Arabia; so it was impossible to\navoid it. We dare not say that all the Arabians were possessed and enchanted by this\nreligion. There were lots of hard- hearted bedouins — among the Arabs — who\nsurrendered (i.e. became Muslims) only because their master did so. Their souls\nwere not sanctified yet. Their tendency to raids had been deeply rooted in their\nsouls. The teachings of Islam had not crystallized their souls well yet. Accounting\nsome of them the Qur’ân says:\n\"The bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to\nbe in ignorance of the limits (Allâh’s Commandments and His legal laws,\netc.) which Allâh has revealed to His Messenger. And Allâh is All- Knower,\nAll- Wise. And of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they\nspend (in Allâh’s cause) as a fine and watch for calamities for you, on them\nbe the calamity of evil. And Allâh is All- Hearer, All- Knower.\" \t[Al- Qur'an\n9:97,98]\n\n-- 294 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n295\nThe Qur’ân praised others saying:\n\"And of the bedouins there are some who believe in Allâh and the Last Day,\nand look upon what they spend in Allâh’s cause as approaches to Allâh, and\na cause of receiving the Messenger’s invocations. Indeed these are an\napproach for them. Allâh will admit them to His Mercy. Certainly Allâh is Oft-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 9:99]\nThose of them who were present at Makkah, Madinah and Thaqif and in many other\nareas of Al- Yemen and Al- Bahrain were different because Islam had been firmly\nrooted in their souls. Some of them were great Companions and Masters of Muslims.\n[Muhadarat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah 1/44; Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/13, 2/626-630; Ibn Hisham 2/501-503, 510-514, 537-542,\n560-601; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/26-60; Fath Al-Bari 8/83-103; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/184-217]\n\n-- 295 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n296\nThe Success and Impact of the Call\nBefore we move one more step and meditate on the last days of the Messenger of\nAllâh’s life, we ought to cast a quick glance at the great work that was a peculiarity\nof his. That very peculiarity that made him excel all other Prophets and Messengers\nand made him so superb that Allâh made him atop the formers and the latters. It\nwas him that was addressed by:\n\"O you wrapped in garments (i.e Prophet Muhammad [pbuh])! Stand (to\npray) all night, except a little.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 73:1,2]\nAnd said:\n\"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments). Arise and warn!\" \t[Al-\nQur'an 74:1,2]\nSo he arose and kept on like that for over twenty years. During those years he\nundertook to carry the burdens of the great expectations on his shoulders for the\nsake of the whole mankind and humanity, the Faith and \tJihad \tin various fields.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] undertook the burdens of struggle and \tAl- Jihad \tin the\nconscience of mankind which was then drowning in the illusions of \tAl- Jahiliyah \tand\nits images that were loaded with the ground weights and gravitations. He took upon\nhis shoulder to free man’s conscience which was chained with desires and lusts. As\nsoon as he had freed the conscience of his Companions from the burdens and heaps\nof \tAl- Jahiliyah \tand earthly life, he started another battle in another field or rather\nsuccessive battles against the enemy of Allâh’s Call, and against those who conspired\nagainst it. It was a battle against those who conspired against the believers and\nagainst those who were so careful to tend that pure plant in its implantation before it\ngrew up and stretched its roots in soil and extended its branches up into the air and\nthus dawned upon other areas. No sooner had he finished the battles in the Arabian\nPeninsula than the Byzantines began preparations to destroy this new nation on the\nnorthern borders.\nThe first battle — i.e. the battle of conscience — was not over yet. It was in fact a\nperpetual one. Satan, who was its leader did not spare a moment without exercising\nhis activity in the depth of human conscience. Muhammad [pbuh], on the other hand\nwas attending on calling to Allâh’s religion there and he was keen on fighting that\nperpetual battle in all fields in spite of their hard circumstances and the world’s\nconspiracy against him. He went on calling effectively and actively surrounded by the\nbelievers who were seeking security through ceaseless toil and great patience.\nThe",
  " Companions acted perpetually and patiently by day and they spent the night\nworshipping their Lord, reciting and memorizing the Qur’ân glorifying and magnifying\nAllâh and imploring Him by night; all that at the behest of their Lord, the All- Mighty.\n[Fi Zilal Al-Qur'an 29/168,169]\nFor over twenty years the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had been leading that\nprogressive steady battle, disregarding any other affairs that kept him off that noble\ngoal. He went on that way till the Islamic Call proved to be successful on a large\nscale that puzzled all men possessed of good reason.\n\n-- 296 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n297\nThe Islamic Call eventually prevailed all over Arabia. It removed all traces of \tAl-\nJahiliyah \tfrom the horizon of the peninsula. The sick minds of \tAl- Jahiliyah \tgrew\nhealthy in Islam. They did not only get rid of idol- worship, but they also knocked\nthem down. The general atmosphere began to echo \"there is no god but Allâh.\" The\ncalls to prayers were heard five times a day penetrating space and breaking the\nsilence of the dead desert and bringing back life through the new belief. Reciters and\nmemorizers of the Qur’ân set out northwards and southwards reciting verses of the\nQur’ân and carrying out Allâh’s injunctions.\nScattered people and tribes were united and man moved from man’s worship of man\nto man’s worship of Allâh. There were no more oppressors nor oppressed; no\nmasters nor slaves, nor people bound to other people, nor aggressors that would\npractise aggression. All people were slaves of Allâh. They were beloved brothers\nobeying Allâh’s rules. Thanks to Allâh they disposed of arrogance and the boastful\nspirit:\n\"An Arab is no better than a non- Arab. In return a non- Arab is no better\nthan an Arab. A red raced man was not better than a black one except in\npiety. Mankind are all Adam’s children and Adam was created from dust.\"\nThanks to the Islamic Call, the Arab unity had become a reality, and so was the case\nwith human unity and social justice as far as their earthly and heavenly affairs were\nconcerned. The time course of events had changed, the features on the earth’s\nsurface and the crooked line of history had grown straight and the mentality had\nbeen rectified.\nThe spirit and the corrupted conscience of people, the distorted values and measures\nof \tAl- Jahiliyah \thad overwhelmed the whole world during that period of \tAl- Jahiliyah.\nThe prevalence of slavery, injustice, extravagant luxury, adultery, depression,\ndeprivity, disbelief, stray from the straight path and darkness; all of those were \tfait\naccomplis \tin spite of the existence of the heavenly religions. The teachings of those\nreligions had grown weak and lost all influence on men’s souls and spirits and\nbecame mere lifeless ritual traditions.\nWhen this Call had accomplished its role in human life, it freed mankind’s spirit of\nsuperstitions, illusions, white slavery, corruption and man’s worship of man. Islam\nhad freed the human society of filth, dissolution, injustice and tyranny. There were\nno more social distinctions, nor clergymen’s or governors’ dictatorship. Islam had set\nup a world built on solid virtuous and clean foundations, it was based on positivity,\nrighteous construction, freedom and renewal. Truth, faith, dignity active steady\ndeeds, the development and improvement of means of living and reclaim of rights\nwere all bases upon which the Islamic state was built. \t[Madha Khasira Al-'Alam bi-Inhitatil-Muslimeen\np.14]\nThanks to these evolutions, Arabia witnessed such an unprecedented blessed\nresurrection, since construction and establishment found its way to it. Never had its\nhistory been so religious, pious and brilliant as it had been during those peculiar days\nof its life.\n\n-- 297 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n298\nThe Farewell Pilgrimage\nAfter the accomplishment of the Call, the proclamation of the Message and the\nestablishment of a new society on the basis of ‘There is no god but Allâh,’ and on\nMuhammad’s mission, a secret call uprose in the heart of the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] telling him that his stay in the Lower World was about to terminate. That was\nclear in his talk to Mu‘adh whom he had dispatched to Yemen in the tenth year of Al-\nHijra: \"O, Mu‘adh! You may not see me after this current year. You may even pass\nby this very Mosque of mine and my tomb.\" Upon hearing that Mu‘adh cried for fear\nthat he would part with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\nAllâh’s care was so bounteous as to let the Prophet [pbuh] see the fruits of his Call\nfor the sake of which he suffered various sorts of trouble for over twenty years.\nThose twenty years had elapsed actively. He used to spend his last days meeting, at\nthe outskirts of Makkah, members of tribes and their representatives who used to\nconsult him and learn the laws and legislation of Islam from him, and in return he\nused to exact their testimony that he had delivered trust and communicated the\nMessage and counselled the people.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] announced an intention to proceed with this blessed\npilgrimage journey himself. Enormous crowds of people came to Madinah, all of\nwhom seek the guidance and \tImamate \tof the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]in the\npilgrimage (Al- Hajj). [Sahih Muslim 1/394] On a Saturday of the last four days of\nDhul- Qa‘dah, the Prophet [pbuh] started the departure preparations procedure.\n[Fath Al- Bari 8/104] He combed his hair, applied some perfume, wore his garment,\nsaddled his camel and set off in the afternoon. He arrived at Dhul- Hulaifa before the\nafternoon prayer. He performed two \tRak‘a \tand spent the night there. When it was\nmorning he said to his Companions:\n\"A comer, sent by my Lord, has called on me tonight and said: ‘Pray in this\nblessed valley and say: I intend ‘Umrah \tcombined with pilgrimage (‘Umrah\ninto \tAl- Hajj).[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/207]\nBefore performing the noon prayer, he bathed for \tIhram \t(ritual consecration), and\n‘Aishah [R] perfumed him on both his body and head with her hand with a \tDharira \t(a\nplant) and with a perfume containing musk. The thick sticky layer of perfume could\nbe seen among his parts of hair and beard. He left it unwashed, wore his loincloth\nand garment. He performed the noon prayer shortened, two \tRak‘a. He proclaimed\npilgrimage procedure associated with ‘Umrah \tat his prayer- place. He, then mounted\nhis she- camel ‘Al- Qaswa’, and proclaimed: ‘There is no god but Allâh’. When he\nmoved into the desert, he acclaimed the Name of Allâh.\nHe proceeded with his journey till he approached Makkah. He spent the night at Dhi\nTuwa and entered Makkah after performing the dawn prayer. He had a bath on\nSunday morning, the fourth of Dhul- Hijjah the tenth year of Al- Hijra. He spent eight\ndays on the way, which was an average period. As soon as he entered Al- Haram\nMosque he circumambulated Al- Ka‘bah and walked to and fro (Sa‘i) between As- Safa\nand Al- Marwah. He did not finish the \tIhram \t(ritual consecration) because he was\nQarin \t(i.e. intending ‘Umrah \tand \tAl- Hajj \tassociated). He then took \tAl- Hadi \t(i.e. the\nsacrificial animals) in order to slaughter them. He camped on a high place of Makkah\n— Al- Hajun. As for circumambulation, he performed only that of \tAl- Hajj \t(pilgrimage\ncircumambulation).\n\n-- 298 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n299\nThose of his Companions who had no \tHadi \twith them to sacrifice, were ordered to\nobserve \tIhram \t(i.e. the state of ritual consecration) into ‘Umrah \t(i.e. lesser\npilgrimage), and circumambulate Al- Ka‘bah and stride ritually to and fro between As-\nSafa and Al- Marwah. After that they could relieve themselves from \tIhram. They,\nhowever, showed reluctance to do what they had been told. Thereupon, the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Had I known beforehand what I knew afterward, I\nwould not bring \tHadi, and if I did not have \tHadi, I would break \tIhram. On hearing\nthese words, his Companions obeyed the orders to the latter.\nOn the eighth day of Dhul- Hijjah — that is the Day of \tTarwiyah, \the left for Mina\nwhere he performed the noon, the afternoon, the sunset, the evening and the dawn\nprayers. — i.e. five prayers. Then he stayed for a while till the sun rose up then he\npassed along till he reached ‘Arafah, where there was a tent built for him at\nNamirah. He sat inside till the sun went down. He ordered that Al- Qaswa’, his she-\ncamel, should be prepared for him. They saddled it and had it ready, so he went\ndown the valley where a hundred thousand and twenty- four or forty- four thousand\npeople gathered round him. There he stood up and delivered the following speech:\n\" O people! Listen to what I say. I do not know whether I will ever meet you\nat this place once again after this current year. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/603] \tIt is unlawful for you\nto shed the blood of one another or take (unlawfully) the fortunes of one another. They are\nas unlawful, (Haram) as shedding blood on such a day as today and in such a month as\nthis \tHaram \tmonth and in such a sanctified city as this sacred city (i.e. Makkah and the\nsurrounding areas).\"\n\"Behold! all practices of paganism and ignorance are now under my feet.\nThe blood- revenge of the Days of Ignorance (pre- Islamic time) are\nremitted. The first claim on blood I abolish is that of Ibn Rabi‘a bin Harith\nwho was nursed in the tribe of Sa‘d and whom Hudhail killed. Usury is\nforbidden, and I make a beginning by remitting the amount of interest\nwhich ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib has to receive. Verily, it is remitted\nentirely.\"\n\"O people! Fear Allâh concerning women. Verily you have taken them on the\nsecurity of Allâh and have made their persons lawful unto you by Words of\nAllâh! It is incumbent upon them to honour their conjugal rights and, not to\ncommit acts of impropriety which, if they do, you have authority to chastise\nthem, yet not severely. If your wives refrain from impropriety and are\nfaithful to you, clothe and feed them suitably.\"\n\"Verily, I have left amongst you the Book of Allâh and the \tSunnah\n(Traditions) of His Messenger which if you hold fast, you shall never go\nastray.\" \t[Sahih Muslim 1/397]\n\"O people, I am not succeeded by a Prophet and you are not succeeded by\nany nation. So I recommend you to worship your Lord, to pray the five\nprayers, to fast Ramadan and to offer the \tZakat \t(poor- due) of your\nprovision willingly. I recommend you to do the pilgrimage to the Sacred\nHouse of your Lord and to obey those who are in charge of you then you will\nbe awarded to enter the Paradise of your Lord.\" \t[Rahmat- ul- lil'alameen 1/263]\n\"And if you were asked about me, what wanted you to say?\"\n\n-- 299 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n300\nThey replied:\n\"We bear witness that you have conveyed the message and discharged your\nministry.\"\nHe then raised his forefinger skywards and then moved it down towards people while\nsaying:\n\"O Allâh, Bear witness.\"\nHe said that phrase thrice. \t[Sahih Muslim 1/397]\nThe one who repeated the Prophet’s [pbuh]statements loudly at ‘Arafat was Rabi‘a\nbin Omaiyah bin Khalaf. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/605]\nAs soon as the Prophet [pbuh] had accomplished delivering the speech, the following\nQur’ânic verse was revealed to him:\n\"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon\nyou, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 5:3]\nUpon hearing this verse ‘Umar cried. \"What makes you cry?\" He was asked. His\nanswer was: \"Nothing succeeds perfection but imperfection.\" \t[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/265]\nBilal called for prayer after the speech, and then made the second call. The Prophet\n[pbuh] performed both of the noon and the afternoon prayers separately, with no\nprayers in between. He then mounted his she- camel Al- Qaswa’, approached the\nlocation of the vigil, directed his face towards \tAl- Qiblah, kept on standing till sunset\nwhen the sky yellow colour vanished a bit and the disc of the sun disappeared.\nOsamah added that the Prophet [pbuh]moved onward to Muzdalifa. where he\nobserved the sunset and the evening prayers with one ‘First call’ and two ‘second\ncalls’. He did not entertain the Glory of Allâh between the two prayers. Then he lay\ndown till it was dawn prayer time. He performed it with one first call and one second\ncall at almost daybreak time. Mounting on his Al- Qaswa’, he moved towards \tAl-\nMash‘ar Al- Haram. He faced \tAl- Qiblah \tand started supplicating: \"Allâh is the\nGreatest. There is no god but Allâh.\" He remained there till it was clear morning and\nbefore the sun rose high, he made his way to Mina. He walked a little and threaded\nthe mid- road leading to the big \tJamrah \twhere he stopped and pelted seven pebbles\nat it saying \"Allâh is the Greatest\" each time. They were like small pebbles hurled\nfrom the bottom of the valley. Then he set off to the sacrificial place, where he\nsacrificed sixty- three camels with his hands, and asked ‘Ali to slaughter the others, a\nhundred and thirty- seven altogether. He made ‘Ali share him in \tAl- Hadi. A piece of\nmeat from each slaughtered animal was ordered to be cooked in a pot and from\nwhich both men ate, and drank the soup.\nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] mounted his she- camel and returned to the\nHouse where he observed the noon prayer at Makkah and there he came upon the\nchildren of ‘Abdul Muttalib were supplying drinking water to people at Zamzam Well.\n\"Draw up water, children of ‘Abdul Muttalib, I would draw up with you if I were not\nafraid that people would appropriate this honour after me.\" They handed him a pail\nof water and he drank to his fill. \t[Sahih Muslim 1/397-400]\n\n-- 300 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n301\nAt the daytime of the tenth of Dhul- Hijjah on the Slaughtering Day (Yaum An- Nahr)\nThe Prophet [pbuh] delivered another speech. That was at high time morning, while\nhe was mounting a grey mule. ‘Ali conveyed his statements to the people, who were\nstanding or sitting. [Abu Da'ud 1/270] He repeated some of the statements that he\nhad previously said the day before. The two Sheikh (Bukhâri and Muslim) reported a\nversion narrated by Abi Bakrah who said:\nThe Prophet [pbuh] made a speech on \tYaum An- Nahr \t(day of slaughtering) and said:\n\"Time has grown similar in form and state to the time when Allâh created\nthe heavens and the earth. A year is twelve months. Four of which are\nSacred Months (Hurum). Three of the four months are successive. They are\nDhul- Qa‘dah, Dhul- Hijjah, and Al- Muharram. The fourth Month is Rajab\nMudar, which comes between Jumada and Sha‘ban.\"\n\"What month is this month?\" He asked. We said: \"Allâh and His Messenger\nknow best of all.\" He kept silent for a while till we thought he would attach\nto it a different appellation. \"Is it not Dhul- Hijjah?\" He wondered. \"Yes. It\nis.\" We said. Then he asked, \"What is this town called?\" We said: \"Allâh and\nHis Messenger know best of all.\" He was silent for a while till we thought he\nwould give it a different name. \"Is it not \tAl- Baldah? \t(i.e. the town)\" asked\nhe. \"Yes. It is.\" We replied. Then he asked again, \"What day is it today?\" We\nreplied: \"Allâh and His Messenger know best of all.\" Then he kept silent for\na while and said wondering: \"Is it not ‘An- Nahr’ (i.e. slaughtering) Day?\"\n\"Yes. It is.\" Said we. Then he said:\n\"(Shedding) the blood of one another and eating or taking one another’s\nprovisions (unwillingly) and your honour are all inviolable (Haram). It is\nunlawful to violate their holiness. They must be as sacred to one another as\nthis sacred day, in this sacred month, in this sacred town.\"\n\"You will go back to be resurrected (after death) to your Lord. There you\nwill be accounted for your deeds. So do not turn into people who go astray\nand kill one another.\"\n\"Have I not delivered the Message (of my Lord)?\" \"Yes you have.\" Said\nthey. \"O Allâh! Bear witness! Let him that is present convey it unto him who\nis absent. For haply, many people to whom the Message is conveyed may be\nmore mindful of it than the audience,.\" said he. \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/234]\nIn another version it is said that the Prophet [pbuh] had said in that very speech:\n\"He whoever plunges into misfortune will certainly aggrieve himself. So let\nno one of you inflict an evil upon his parents. Verily Satan has utterly\ndespaired being worshipped in this country of yours; but he will be obeyed\nat your committing trivial things you disdain. Satan will be contented with\nsuch things.\" \t[At- Tirmidhi 2/38, 135; Mishkat Al- Masabih 1/234]\n\n-- 301 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n302\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] spent \tAt- Tashreeq \tDays (11th, 12th and 13th of\nDhul- Hijjah) in Mina performing the ritual teachings of Islam, remembering Allâh\n(praying), following the ways of guidance of Ibrahim, wiping out all traces and\nfeatures or polytheism. On some days of \tAt- Tashreeq \the delivered some speeches as\nwell. In a version to Abu Da’ûd with good reference to Sira,’ the daughter of Nabhan;\nshe said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made us a speech at the \tRu’us \t(Heads)\nDay in which he said: \"Is it not this the middle day of \tAt- Tashreeq \tDays.\" \t[Abu Da'ud\n1/269]\nHis speech that day was similar to that of \tAn- Nahr \tDay’s. It was made after the\nrevelation of \tSurat An- Nasr.\nOn the second day of \tAn- Nafr \t(i.e. Departure) — on the thirteenth of Dhul- Hijjah, the\nProphet [pbuh] proceeded with \tAn- Nafr \tto Mina and stayed at a high place of a\nmountain side at Bani Kinanah from Al- Abtah. He spent the rest of that day and\nnight there — where he performed the noon, the afternoon, the sunset and the\nevening prayers.\nThen he slept for a short while and mounted leaving for the Ka‘bah. He performed\nthe Farewell Circumambulation (Tawaf Al- Wada‘), after ordering his Companions to\ndo the same thing.\nUpon the accomplishment of his religious rituals he quickened his move to the\npurified Madinah. He went there not to seek rest but to resume the strife and\nstruggle in the way of Allâh. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/631, 2/631; Ibn Hisham 2/601-605; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 1/196, 218-220]\n\n-- 302 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n303\nThe Last Expeditions\nThe pride of the Byzantine State made it deny Muslims their right to live. The\nByzantine arrogance made them even kill those agents of theirs, who embraced\nIslam. Killing Farwah bin ‘Amr Al- Judhami, who was their agent on Mu’an, was an\nevidence of their arrogance. Due to that arrogance and presumptuousness of the\nByzantines, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started to mobilize a great army in Safar\nin the eleventh year of Al- Hijra and made it under the command of Osamah bin Zaid\nbin Haritha with orders to have the horses of Muslims tread on the lands bordering\nAl- Balqa’ and Ad- Darum of Palestine. His aim was to terrorize Byzantines and to\nimplant confidence into the hearts of Arabs who were settled at the borders of the\nByzantines. His other purpose was to deliver a message to everybody there, so that\nno one may dare say that the Church brutality can’t go with impunity; and that\nIslamization is not synonymous with fear and vulnerability.\nThe leadership of Osamah was subject to criticism. Because he was still too young,\npeople tarried at joining his expedition. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] addressed\npeople saying:\n\"No wonder now you contest his leadership, for you have already contested\nthe ex- leadership of his father. Yes, by Allâh, his father, who was one of the\nmost beloved people to me, was quite efficient for leadership; and this son\nof his is one of the most beloved individuals to me after his father.\" \t[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 2/612]\nSo people started tending towards Osamah and joined his army. The number of\nvolunteers in his army was so enormous that they formed such a long queue that\nthey had to descend the escarpment — which was a parasang off Madinah. The\nanxiety- provoking news about the Messenger of Allâh’s sickness, however, made the\nexpedition tarry again in order to know what Allâh had willed as regards His\nMessenger [pbuh].\nIt was Allâh’s Will that Osamah’s expedition would be the first one dispatched during\nthe caliphate of the veracious Abu Bakr. \t[Ibn Hisham 2/560, 606; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/612]\n\n-- 303 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n304\nThe Journey to Allâh, the Sublime\nSymptoms of Farewell\nWhen the Call to Islam grew complete and the new faith dominated the whole\nsituation. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started to develop certain symptoms that\nbespoke of leave- taking. They could be perceived through his statements and deeds:\nIn Ramadan in the tenth year of Al- Hijra he secluded himself for twenty days\nin contrast to ten, previously.\nThe archangel Gabriel reviewed the Qur’ân twice with him.\nHis words in the Farewell Pilgrimage (i.e. Al- Wida‘):\"I do not know whether\nI will ever meet you at this place once again after this current year.\"\nThe revelation of \tAn- Nasr \tChapter amid \tAt- Tashreeq \tDays. So when it was\nsent down on him, he realized that it was the parting time and that \tSurah \twas\nan announcement of his approaching death.\nOn the early days of Safar in the eleventh year of Al- Hijra, the Prophet [pbuh]\nwent out to Uhud and observed a farewell prayer to the martyrs. It looked\nlike saying goodbye to both the dead and the living alike. He then ascended\nthe pulpit and addressed the people saying: \t\"I am to precede you and I\nhave been made witness upon you. By Allâh, you will meet me at the\n‘Fountain’ very soon. I have been given the keys of worldly treasures.\nBy Allâh, I do not fear for you that you will turn polytheists after me.\nBut I do fear that acquisition of worldly riches should entice you to\nstrike one another’s neck.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/585]\nOne day, at midnight he went to Al- Baqee‘ cemetry, and implored Allâh to\nforgive the martyrs of Islam. He said: \"Peace be upon you tomb- dwellers!\nMay that morning that dawns upon you be more relieving than that which\ndawn upon the living. Afflictions are approaching them like cloudy lumps of a\ndark night — the last of which follows the first. The last one is bearing more\nevil than the first.\" He comforted them saying: \"We will follow you.\"\nThe Start of the Disease\nOn Monday the twenty- ninth of Safar in the eleventh year of Al- Hijra, he participated\nin funeral rites in Al- Baqee‘. On the way back he had a headache, his temperature\nrose so high that the heat effect could be felt over his headband.\nHe led the Muslims in prayer for eleven days though he was sick. The total number\nof his sick days were either thirteen or fourteen.\nThe Last Week\nWhen his sickness grew severe he asked his wives: \"Where shall I stay tomorrow?\"\n\"Where shall I stay?\" They understood what he wanted. So they allowed him to stay\n\n-- 304 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n305\nwherever he wished. He moved to ‘Aishah’s room leaning — while he was walking —\non Al- Fadl bin Al- ‘Abbas and ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. Head banded as he was, he dragged\nhis feet till he came into her abode. It was there that he spent the last week of his\nlife.\nDuring that period, ‘Aishah used to recite \tAl- Mu‘awwidhat \t(Chapters 113 and 114 of\nthe Qur’ân) and other supplications which he had already taught her.\nFive days before death\nOn Wednesday, five days before he died the Prophet’s temperature rose so high\nsignalling the severeness of his disease. He fainted and suffered from pain. \"Pour out\non me seven \tQirab \t(water skin pots) of various water wells so that I may go out to\nmeet people and talk to them.\" So they seated him in a container (usually used for\nwashing) and poured out water on him till he said: \"That is enough. That is enough.\"\nThen he felt well enough to enter the Mosque. He entered it band- headed, sat on the\npulpit and made a speech to the people who were gathering together around him. He\nsaid:\n\"The curse of Allâh falls upon the Jews and Christians for they have made\nt heir Prophets’ tombs places of worship.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/62; Mustta' Imam\nMalik p.360]\nThen he said:\n\"Do not make my tomb a worshipped idol.\" \t[Muatta' Imam Malik p.65]\nThen he offered himself and invited the people to repay any injuries he might have\ninflicted on them, saying:\n\"He whom I have ever lashed his back, I offer him my back so that he may\navenge himself on me. He whom I have ever blasphemed his honour, here I\nam offering my honour so that he may avenge himself.\"\nThen he descended, and performed the noon prayer. Again he returned to the pulpit\nand sat on it. He resumed his first speech about enmity and some other things.\nA man then said: \"You owe me three Dirhams.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Fadl, pay\nhim the money.\" He went on saying:\n\"I admonish you to be good to \tAl- Ansar \t(the Helpers). They are my family\nand with them I found shelter. They have acquitted themselves credibly of\nthe responsibility that fell upon them and now there remains what you have\nto do. You should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that they\nhave shown, and should overlook their faults.\"\nIn another version:\n\n-- 305 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n306\n\"The number of believers would increase, but the number of Helpers would\ndecrease to the extent that they would be among men as salt in the food. So\nhe who from among you occupies a position of responsibility and is powerful\nenough to do harm or good to the people, he should fully acknowledge and\nappreciate the favour that these benefactors have shown and overlook their\nfaults.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/536]\nAnd said:\n\"Allâh, the Great, has given a slave of His the opportunity to make a choice\nbetween whatever he desires of Allâh’s provisions in this world, and what\nHe keeps for him in the world, but he has opted for the latter.\"\nAbu Sa‘îd Al- Khudri said: \"Upon hearing that, Abu Bakr cried and said: ‘We sacrifice\nour fathers and mothers for your sake.’ We wondered why Abu Bakr said such a\nthing. People said: ‘Look at that old man! The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] says about\na slave of Allâh who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world\nand the bounty of Allâh in the Hereafter, but he says: We sacrifice our fathers and\nmothers for your sake!’ It was later on that we realized what he had aimed at. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] was the slave informed to choose. We also acknowledged\nthat Abu Bakr was the most learned among us.\" \t[Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/546]\nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said:\n\"The fellow I feel most secure in his company is Abu Bakr. If I were to make\nfriendship with any other one than Allâh, I would have Abu Bakr a bosom\nfriend of mine. For him I feel affection and brotherhood of Islam. No gate\nshall be kept open in the Mosque except that of Abu Bakr’s.\" \t[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/22, 429, 449, 2/638; Mishkat Al- Masabih 2/548]\nFour days before his death\nOn Thursday, four days before the death of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], he said to\npeople — though he was suffering from a severe pain: \"Come here. I will cause you\nto write something so that you will never fall into error.\" Upon this ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab said: \"The Prophet of Allâh [pbuh] is suffering from acute pain and you have\nthe Qur’ân with you; the Book of Allâh is sufficient unto you.\" Others however\nwanted the writing to be made. When Muhammad [pbuh] heard them debating over\nit, he ordered them to go away and leave him alone. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/637]\nThat day he recommended three things:\n1. \tJews, Christians and polytheists should be expelled out of Arabia.\n2. \tHe recommended that delegations should be honoured and entertained, in a\nway similar to the one he used to do.\n3. \tAs for the third — the narrator said that he had forgotten it. It could have\nbeen adherence to the Holy Book and the \tSunnah. It was likely to be the\naccomplishment and the mobilization of Osamah’s army, or it could have been\nperformance of prayers and being attentive to slaves.\n\n-- 306 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n307\nIn spite of the strain of disease and suffering from pain, the Prophet [pbuh] used to\nlead all the prayers till that Thursday — four days before he died. On that day he led\nthe sunset prayer and recited:\n\"By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allâh) sent forth one after\nanother.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 77:1] \t[Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/102]\nIn the evening he grew so sick that he could not overcome the strain of disease or\ngo out to enter the Mosque. ‘Aishah said: The Prophet [pbuh] asked: \"Have the\npeople performed the prayer?\" \"No. They haven’t. They are waiting for you.\" \"Put\nsome water in the washing pot.\" Said he. We did what he ordered. So he washed\nand wanted to stand up, but he fainted. When he came round he asked again \"Have\nthe people prayed?\" Then the same sequence of events took place again and again\nfor the second and the third times from the time he washed to the time he fainted\nafter his attempts to stand up. Therefore he sent to Abu Bakr to lead the prayer\nhimself. Abu Bakr then led the prayer during those days. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/99]\nThey were seventeen prayers in the lifetime of Muhammad [pbuh].\nThree or four times ‘Aishah talked to the Prophet [pbuh] to exempt Abu Bakr from\nleadership in prayer lest people should despair of him, but he refused and said:\n\"You (women) are like the women who tried to entice Joseph (Yusuf) into\nimmorality. Convey my request to Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.\"\nA Day or Two prior to Death\nOn Saturday or on Sunday, the Prophet [pbuh] felt that he was well enough to\nperform the prayer; so he went out leaning on two men in order to perform the noon\nprayer. Abu Bakr, who was then about to lead the prayer withdrew when he saw him\ncoming; but the Prophet [pbuh] made him a gesture to stay where he was and said:\n\"Seat me next to him.\" They seated him on the left hand side of Abu Bakr. The\nProphet [pbuh] led the prayer, and Abu Bakr followed him and raised his voice at\nevery ‘Allâhu \tAkbar’ \t(i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) the Prophet [pbuh] said, so that the\npeople may hear clearly. \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/98,99]\nA Day before his Death\nOn Sunday, a day before he died, the Prophet [pbuh] set his slaves free, paid as a\ncharity the seven Dinars he owned and gave his weapons as a present to the\nMuslims. So when night fell ‘Aishah had to borrow some oil from her neighbour to\nlight her oil- lantern.\nEven his armour was mortgaged as a security with a Jew for thirty \tSa‘ \t(a cubic\nmeasure) of barley.\nTh",
  "e Last Day Alive\nIn a narration by Anas bin Malik, he said: \"While the Muslims were performing the\ndawn prayer on Monday — led by Abu Bakr, they were surprised to see the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] raising the curtain of ‘Aishah’s room. He looked at them\n\n-- 307 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n308\nwhile they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully. Seeing him, Abu\nBakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer. For he\nthought that the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to go out and pray.\" Anas said: \"The\nMuslims, who were praying, were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured\nat their prayers. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made them a gesture to continue\ntheir prayer, went into the room and drew down the curtain.\" \t[ibid 2/640]\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] did not live for the next prayer time.\nWhen it was daytime, the Prophet [pbuh] called Fatimah and told her something in a\nsecret voice that made her cry. Then he whispered to her something else which\nmade her laugh. ‘Aishah enquired from her after the Prophet’s death, as to this\nweeping and laughing to which Fatimah replied: \"The first time he disclosed to me\nthat he would not recover from his illness and I wept. Then he told me that I would\nbe the first of his family to join him, so I laughed.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/638]\nHe gave Fatimah glad tidings that she would become the lady of all women of the\nworld. \t[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/282]\nFatimah witnessed the great pain that afflicted her father. So she said: \"What great\npain my father is in!\". To these words, the Prophet [pbuh] remarked:\n\"He will not suffer any more when today is over.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 2/641]\nHe asked that Al- Hasan and Al- Husain be brought to him. He kissed them and\nrecommended that they be looked after. He asked to see his wives. They were\nbrought to him. He preached them and told them to remember Allâh. Pain grew so\nmuch severe that the trace of poison he had at Khaibar came to light. It was so sore\nthat he said to ‘Aishah: \"I still feel the painful effect of that food I tasted at Khaibar.\nI feel as if death is approaching.\" [ibid 2/637] He ordered the people to perform the\nprayers and be attentive to slaves. He repeated it several times. \t[ibid 2/637]\nThe Prophet [pbuh] breathes his Last\nWhen the pangs of death started, ‘Aishah leant him against her. She used to say:\nOne of Allâh’s bounties upon me is that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] died in my\nhouse, while I am still alive. He died between my chest and neck while he was\nleaning against me. Allâh has mixed his saliva with mine at his death. For ‘Abdur\nRahman — the son of Abu Bakr — came in with a \tSiwak \t(i.e. the root of a desert\nplant used for brushing teeth) in his hand, while I was leaning the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] against me. I noticed that he was looking at the \tSiwak, so I asked him — for\nI knew that he wanted it — \"Would you like me to take it for you?\" He nodded in\nagreement. I took it and gave it to him. As it was too hard for him, I asked him\n\"Shall I soften it for you?\" He nodded in agreement. So I softened it with my saliva\nand he passed it (on his teeth).\nIn another version it is said: \"So he brushed (Istanna) his teeth as nice as he could.\"\nThere was a water container (Rakwa) available at his hand with some water in. He\nput his hand in it and wiped his face with it and said:\n\"There is no god but Allâh. Death is full of agonies.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/640]\n\n-- 308 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n309\nAs soon as he had finished his \tSiwak \tbrushing, he raised his hand or his finger up,\nlooked upwards to the ceiling and moved his lips. So ‘Aishah listened to him. She\nheard him say: \"With those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace with the\nProphets and the Truthful ones (As- Siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the good doers. O\nAllâh, forgive me and have mercy upon me and join me to the Companionship on\nhigh.\" [ibid 2/638- 641] Then at intervals he uttered these words: \"The most exalted\nCompanionship on high. To Allâh we turn and to Him we turn back for help and last\nabode.\" This event took place at high morning time on Monday, the twelfth of Rabi‘\nAl- Awwal, in the eleventh year of Al- Hijrah. He was sixty- three years and four days\nold when he died.\nThe Companions’ concern over the Prophet’s Death\nThe great (loss) news was soon known by everybody in Madinah. Dark grief spread\non all areas and horizons of Madinah. Anas said:\n\"I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] came to us; and I have never witnessed a more\nawful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\ndied on.\" \t[Mishkat-ul-Masabih 2/547]\nWhen he died, Fatimah said: \"O Father, whom his Lord responded to his\nsupplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise. O Father, whom I announce his\ndeath to Gabriel.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/641]\n‘Umar’s Attitude\n‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before\npeople addressing them: \"Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] died. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] did not die, but went to his Lord in the\nsame way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came\nback though they said he had been dead. By Allâh, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nwill come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death.\"\n[Ibn Hisham 2/655]\nAbu Bakr’s Attitude\nAbu Bakr left his house at As- Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare- back.\nAt the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he\nentered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]\nwas. The Prophet [pbuh] was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face\nand tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: \"I sacrifice my father and\nmother for your sake. Allâh, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just\nexperienced the death that Allâh had ordained.\"\nThen he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: \"‘Umar, be seated.\"\n‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abu Bakr, who\nstarted a speech saying:\n\"And now, he who worships Muhammad [pbuh]. Muhammad is dead now.\nBut he who worships Allâh, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says:\n\n-- 309 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n310\n‘Muhammad ([pbuh])is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many)\nMessengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you\nthen turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on\nhis heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward\nto those who are grateful.’\" \t[Al- Qur'an 3:144]\nIbn ‘Abbas said: \"By Allâh, it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’ânic\nverse till Abu Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was\nno man who did not recite it.\"\nIbn Al- Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: \"By Allâh, as soon as I heard Abu Bakr\nsay it, I fell down to the ground. I felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so I\ncollapsed when I heard him say it. Only then did I realize that Muhammad [pbuh]\nhad really died.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/640,641]\nBurial and Farewell Preparations to his Honourable Body\nDispute about who would succeed him [pbuh] broke out even before having the\nMessenger of Allâh’s body prepared for burial. Lots of arguments, discussions,\ndialogues took place between the Helpers and Emigrants in the roofed passage\n(portico) of Bani Sa‘ida. Finally they acknowledged Abu Bakr [R]e as a caliph. They\nspent the whole Monday there till it was night. People were so busy with their\narguments that it was late night — just about dawn of Tuesday — yet his blessed\nbody was still lying on his bed covered with an inked- garment. He was locked in the\nroom.\nOn Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al- ‘Abbas,\n‘Ali, Al- Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al- ‘Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the\nMessenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al- ‘Abbas, Al- Fadl and\nQathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. ‘Ali\nwashed him and Aws leant him against his chest.\nThey shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth\n[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/169; Sahih Muslim 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in.\nA sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abu Bakr said: \"I heard\nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] say: ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’ So Abu\nTalhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make\nthe tomb.\nPeople entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet [pbuh]. The first to\npray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women\nprayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray.\nThis process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes\nWednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: \"We did not know that the Prophet [pbuh] was\nbeing buried till we heard the sound of tools digging the ground at the depth of\nWednesday night.\" \t[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.471; Ibn Hisham 2/649-665; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al-Athar p.38, 39;\nRahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/277-286]\n\n-- 310 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n311\nThe Prophet Household\n1. \tKhadijah Bint Khuwailid: \tIn Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s\nhousehold comprised him [pbuh] and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was\ntwenty- five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first\nwoman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons\nand daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their\ndaughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.\nZainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al- ‘As bin Al- Rabi‘ and that\nwas before Al- Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to\n‘Uthman bin ‘Affan ÑÖì Çááå Úäå successively (i.e. he married one after the\ndeath of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in\nthe period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that\nFatimah and ‘Ali had were Al- Hasan, Al- Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.\nIt is well- known that the Prophet [pbuh] was exceptionally authorized to have\nmore than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were\nthirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the\nMother of the poor (Umm Al- Masakeen) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two\nothers with whom he did not consummate his marriage.\n2. \tSawdah bint Zam‘a: \tHe married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of\nProphethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was\nmarried to a paternal cousin of hers called As- Sakran bin ‘Amr.\n3. \t‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr: \tHe married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood,\na year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before\nAl- Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not\nconsummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al- Hijra,\nand that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he\nmarried, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the\nmost learnèd woman in jurisprudence.\n4. \tHafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al- Khattab: \tShe was \tAiyim \t(i.e. husbandless). Her\nex- husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As- Sahmi in the period between Badr\nand Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her in the third year\nof Al- Hijra.\n5. \tZainab bint Khuzaimah: \tShe was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was\nnicknamed \tUmm Al- Masakeen, because of her kindness and care towards\nthem. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at\nUhud, was married to the Prophet [pbuh] in the fourth year of Al- Hijra, but\nshe died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh].\n6. \tUmm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah: \tShe used to be the wife of Abu\nSalamah, who died in Jumada Al- Akhir, in the fourth year of Al- Hijra. The\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her in Shawwal of the same year.\n7. \tZainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab: \tShe was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and\nwas the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha —\nwho was then considered son of the Prophet [pbuh] . However, Zaid divorced\nher. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:\n\n-- 311 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n312\n\"So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced\nher), We gave her to you in marriage.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:37]\nAbout her, Allâh has sent down some verses of \tAl- Ahzab \tChapter that\ndiscussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this\nlater. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her in Dhul- Qa‘dah, the fifth\nyear of Al- Hijra.\n8. \tJuwairiyah bint Al- Harith: \tAl- Harith was the head of Bani Al- Mustaliq of\nKhuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani\nAl- Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He\nmade her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth\nyear of Al- Hijra.\n9. \tUmm Habibah: \tRamlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to\n‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia). When\n‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion\nand refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia\n(Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-\nDamri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand —\nthat was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al- Hijra. Negus agreed and sent\nher to the Prophet [pbuh] in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.\n10. \tSafiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab: \tFrom the Children of Israel, she was\namong the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] took\nher for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the\nseventh year of Al- Hijra.\n11. \tMaimunah bint Al- Harith: \tThe daughter of Al- Harith, and the sister\nof Umm Al- Fadl Lubabah bint Al- Harith. The Prophet [pbuh] married her after\nthe Compensatory \t‘Umrah \t(Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul- Qa‘dah in\nthe seventh year of Al- Hijra.\nThose were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had married and\nconsummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab,\nthe \tUmm Al- Masakeen. \tWhereas the other nine wives outlived him.\nThe two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab\nand the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al- Jauniyah.\nBesides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an\nEgyptian Christian), a present gift from Al- Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave\nbirth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the 28th or\n29th of Shawwal in the year 10 A.H., i.e. 27th January, 632 A.D. The second one\nwas Raihanah bint Zaid An- Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza.\nSome people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al- Qaiyim gives more\nweight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a\ncaptive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh. \t[Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 1/29]\nWhosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], will conceive that\nhis marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he\nhad almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old\nwife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful\n\n-- 312 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n313\ndesire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact\nmotivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal\nmarriages usually aim at.\nThe tendency of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] towards establishing a relationship by\nmarriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah —\nand getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of\nhis two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that\nhe aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and\ngreat achievements in the cause of Islam are well- known.\nBesides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in- law relations. For\nthem a son or a daughter- in- law was a means by which they sought the\nconsolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights\nagainst alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and\ndegradation to them.\nBy marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to demolish or\nbreak down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred.\nUmm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-\nWaleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] produced good results.\nKhalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the\nMessenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a\nshort time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.\nAfter the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father,\ndid not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah\nand Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility\nagainst Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of\nblessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet [pbuh],\nhis Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: \"It is for their\naffinity with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\" No need to say what great good\nimpression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all\nis Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had\nknown nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach\nthem to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the\nsolidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.\nAn essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and\nwomen. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is\nimpossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] had to\nselect some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them\nsystematically in order to educate she- bedouins and townswomen, old and young,\nand thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The\nMothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet [pbuh]) were in such a convenient\nposition that they could convey the state of the Prophet [pbuh] and his affairs to\npeople (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of\nIslam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in\nconveying Prophetic traditions \tAhadith \tto the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related\na large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.\n\n-- 313 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n314\nHis marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which\naimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre- Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of\nchildren. In \tAl- Jahiliyah \tthe Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a\nreal son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That \tJahiliyah\ntradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or\nuproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those\nconcerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and\nbrought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against\nsuch deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.\nFor the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger [pbuh] to\nmarry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex- wife to Zaid. She was at variance\nwith Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when\nthe Confederates (Al- Ahzab) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] feared that the\nhypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to\ninfluence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce\nher, in order not to get involved into that trial.\nUndoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet\n[pbuh] . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had\nbeen sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:\n\"And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha ÑÖì Çááå Úäå —\nthe freed slave of the Prophet [pbuh]) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace\n(by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad [pbuh] too) have done\nfavour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’\nBut you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you\nthat He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make\nmanifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh] married the\ndivorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that\nyou should fear him.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:37]\nFinally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her at the\ntime he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her \tIddat \t(i.e.\nperiod during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had\nalready ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the\nmarriage Himself by saying:\n\"So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We\ngave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to\nthe believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons\nwhen the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced\nthem).\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:37]\nAnd that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after\nHe had done it in words:\n\"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just\nnear Allâh.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:5]\n\n-- 314 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n315\n\"Muhammad ([pbuh]) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the\nMessenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 33:40]\nLots of deeply- rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted\nby mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the\nadvocate of the Message himself.\nThis could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al- Hudaibiyah\n‘Umrah \t(Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al- Thaqafi saw certain\nMuslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet [pbuh].\nHe also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it.\nThere were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others\npledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent\nCompanions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the\nProphet [pbuh] and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s\nordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-\nHudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet [pbuh] to\nfeel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah [R] advised that he take the initiative\nand sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence\nin support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of\nexterminating a deeply- established tradition.\nHypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against\nthat marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill- effects on those\nMuslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and\nthe Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son,\nand so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the\nArabians.\nAl- Ahzab \tSurah \twas revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not\nrecognize adoption of children, and the Prophet [pbuh] is given (by Allâh) more\nfreedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to\nachieve noble and honourable purposes.\nHowever, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to his wives was of\nhonourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour,\nsatisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of\nhousework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house- life was hard and\nunbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life:\n\"According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has never tasted a thin\nflattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted\nmutton.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/956]\n‘Aishah said: \"Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three\ncrescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] (i.e. they did not cook food).\" \"What did you eat to sustain yourselves?\"\n‘Urwah asked. She said \"The two blacks: dates and water\" [ibid 2/956]. Lots of\ninformation about the hard life of the Prophet [pbuh] were told.\nIn spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet\n[pbuh], none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but\nonce. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was\n\n-- 315 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n316\nnot so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule.\nAllâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated\nin the following verses:\n\" O Prophet (Muhammad [pbuh])! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of\nthis world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and\nset you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His\nMessenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared\nfor \tAl- Muhsinat \t(good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’\" \t[Al- Qur'an\n33:28,29]\nThey were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and\nits glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.\nAlthough they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that\nnormally happen among co- wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could\nbe the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that,\nso they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in \tAt- Tahreem\nChapter:\n\"O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful\nto you …\" \t[Al- Qur'an 66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).\nDiscussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is\nfamiliar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their\nsorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the\ntrials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their\ndisregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness\nof polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill- practices featuring it,\ncould truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are\nDivine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.\n\n-- 316 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n317\nThe Prophet [pbuh], Attributes and Manners\nThe Prophet [pbuh] combined both perfection of creation and perfection of manners.\nThis impression on people can be deduced by the bliss that overwhelmed their hearts\nand filled them with dignity. Men’s dignity, devotion and estimation of the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] were unique and matchless. No other man in the whole world has\nbeen so honoured and beloved. Those who knew him well, were fascinated and\nenchanted by him. They were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of saving a\nnail of his from hurt or injury. Being privileged by lots of prerogatives of perfection\nthat no one else had been endowed with, his Companions found that he was peerless\nand so they loved him.\nHere we list a brief summary of the versions about his beauty and perfection. To\nencompass all which is, addmittedly, beyond our power.\nBeauty of Creation\nDescribing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who passed by her tent on his journey of\nmigration, Umm Ma‘bad Al- Khuza‘iyah said to her husband:\n\"He was innocently bright and had broad countenance. His manners were fine. Neither was his belly\nbulging out nor was his head deprived of hair. He had black attractive eyes finely arched by continuous\neyebrows. His hair glossy and black, inclined to curl, he wore long. His voice was extremely commanding.\nHis head was large, well formed and set on a slender neck. His expression was pensive and contemplative,\nserene and sublime. The stranger was fascinated from the distance, but no sooner he became intimate with\nhim than this fascination was changed into attachment and respect. His expression was very sweet and\ndistinct. His speech was well set and free from the use of superfluous words, as if it were a rosary of beads.\nHis stature was neither too high nor too small to look repulsive. He was a twig amongst the two, singularly\nbright and fresh. He was always surrounded by his Companions. Whenever he uttered something, the\nlisteners would hear him with rapt attention and whenever he issued any command, they vied with each\nother in carrying it out. He was a master and a commander. His utterances were marked by truth and\nsincerity, free from all kinds of falsehoods and lies.\" [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/45]\nAli bin Abi Talib describing him said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was neither excessively tall nor\nextremely short. He was medium height among his friends. His hair was neither curly nor wavy. It was in\nbetween. It was not too cur",
  "ly nor was it plain straight. It was both curly and wavy combined. His face was\nnot swollen or meaty-compact. It was fairly round. His mouth was white. He had black and large eyes with\nlong haired eyelids. His joints (limbs) and shoulder joints were rather big. He had a rod-like little hair\nextending from his chest down to his navel, but the rest of his body was almost hairless. He had thick hand\npalms and thick fingers and toes. At walking, he lifted his feet off the ground as if he had been walking in a\nmuddy remainder of water. When he turned, he turned all. The Prophethood Seal was between his\nshoulders. He is the Seal of Prophets, the most generous and the bravest of all.\nHis speech was the most reliable. He was the keenest and the most attentive to people’s trust and was very\ncareful to pay people’s due in full. The Prophet [pbuh] was the most tractable and the most yielding\ncompanion, seeing him unexpectedly you fear him and venerate him. He who has acquaintance with him\nwill like him. He who describes him says:\n‘I have never seen such a person neither before nor after seeing him.’ \" \t[Ibn Hisham 1/401; Jami' At-Tirmidhi\n4/303]\n\n-- 317 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n318\nJabir bin Samurah reported that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] had a broad face with reddish (wide) eyes and\nlean heels. \t[Sahih Al-Muslim 2/258]\nAbu At-Tufail said: \"He was white, good-looking. He was neither fat nor thin; neither tall nor short.\"\nAnas bin Malik said: \"He had unfolded hands and was pink-coloured. He was neither white nor brown. He\nwas rather whitish. In both his head and beard there were as many as twenty grey hairs, besides some grey\nhairs at his temples.\" In another version: \"and some scattered white hairs in his head.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/502]\nAbu Juhaifa said: \"I have seen some grey colour under his lower lip.\" Al-Bara’ said: \"He was of medium\nheight, broad-shouldered, his hair went up to his earlobes. I saw him dressed in a red garment and I (assure\nyou) I have never seen someone more handsome. At first he used to let his hair loose so as to be in\ncompliance with the people of the Book; but later on he used to part it.\" \t[ibid 1/503]\nAl-Bara’ also said: \"He had the most handsome face and the best character.\" When he was asked: \"Was the\nMessenger’s face sword-like?\" \"No,\" he said: \"it was moon-like.\" But in another version: he said, \"His face\nwas round.\" Ar-Rabi‘ bint Muawwidh said: \"Had you seen him, you would have felt that the sun was\nshining.\" Jabir bin Samurah said, \"I saw him at one full-moony night. I looked at him. He was dressed in a\nred garment. I compared him with the moon and found that — for me — he was better than the moon.\"\n[Mishkat Al-Masabeeh 2/518]\nAbu Huraira said: \"I have never seen a thing nicer than the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. It seems as if the\nsunlight were moving within his face. I have never seen one who is faster in pace than the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh]. It seemed as if the earth had folded itself up to shorten the distance for him. For we used to\nwear ourselves out while he was at full ease.\" \t[ibid 2/518]\nKa‘b bin Malik said: \"When he was pleased, his face would shine with so bright light that you would\nbelieve that it was a moon-piece.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/502] Once he sweated hot at ‘Aishah’s, and the\nfeatures of his face twinkled; so I recited a poem by Abu Kabeer Al-Hudhali:\n\"If you watch his face-features, you will see them twinkling like the lightning of an approaching rain.\"\n[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/72]\nWhenever Abu Bakr saw him he would say:\n\"He is faithful, chosen (by Allâh), and calls for forgiveness. He shines like a full-moon light when it is far\nfrom dark (clouds).\" [Khulasa As-Siyar p.20]\n‘Umar used to recite verses by Zuhair describing Haram bin Sinan:\n\"Were you other than a human being, you would be a lighted moon at a full-moon night.\"\nThen he would add: \"Thus was the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. [ibid]\nWhen he got angry his face would go so red that you would think it were \"an\ninflected red skin- spot with pomegranate grains on both cheeks.\" \t[Mishkat Al-Masabeeh 1/22]\nJabir bin Samurah said: \"His legs were gentle, delicate and in conformity. His\nlaughter is no more than smiling. Looking at him will make you say ‘He is black- eyed\nthough he is not so.’\" \t[Jami' At-Tirmidhi 4/306]\n\n-- 318 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n319\nIbn Al- ‘Abbas said: \"His two front teeth were splitted so whenever he speaks, light\ngoes through them. His neck was as pure and silvery as a neck of doll. His eyelids\nwere long haired but his beard was thick. His forehead was broad; but his eyebrows\nwere like the metal piece attached to a lance, but they were unhorned. His nose was\nhigh- tipped, middle- cambered with narrow nostrils. His cheeks were plain, but he\nhad (little hair) running down like a rod from his throat to his navel. He had hair\nneither on his abdomen nor on his chest except some on his arms and shoulders. His\nchest was broad and flatted. He had long forearms with expansive palms of the\nhand. His legs were plain straight and stretching down. His other limbs were straight\ntoo. The two hollows of his soles hardly touch the ground. When he walks away he\nvanishes soon; but he walks at ease (when he is not in a hurry). The way he walks\nseems similar to one who is leaning forwards and is about to fall down.\" \t[Khulasa As-Siyar\np.19,20]\nAnas said: \"I have never touched silk or a silky garment softer than the palm of the\nProphet’s [pbuh]; nor have I smelt a perfume or any scent nicer than his.\" In\nanother version, \"I have never smelt ambergris nor musk nor any other thing\nsweeter than the scent and the smell of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\"\nAbu Juhaifa said: \"I took his hand and put it on my head and I found that it was\ncolder than ice and better scented than the musk perfume.\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/503]\nJabir bin Samurah — who was a little child then — said: \"When he wiped my cheek, I\nfelt it was cold and scented as if it had been taken out of a shop of a perfume\nworkshop.\" \t[Sahih Muslim 2/256]\nAnas said, \"His sweat was pearl- like.\" Umm Sulaim said: \"His sweat smelt nicer than\nthe nicest perfume.\"\nJabir said: \"Whoever pursues a road that has been trodden by the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh], will certainly scent his smell and will be quite sure that the Messenger\nof Allâh [pbuh] has already passed it.\" The Seal of Prophethood, which was similar in\nsize to a pigeon’s egg, was between his shoulders on the left side having spots on it\nlike moles. \t[ibid 2/259]\nThe Perfection of Soul and Nobility\nThe Prophet [pbuh] was noted for superb eloquence and fluency in Arabic. He was\nremarkable in position and rank. He was an accurate, unpretending straightforward\nspeaker. He was well- versed in Arabic and quite familiar with the dialects and\naccents of every tribe. He spoke with his entertainers using their own accents and\ndialects. He mastered and was quite eloquent at both bedouin and town speech. So\nhe had the strength and eloquence of bedouin language as well as the clarity and the\ndecorated splendid speech of town. Above all, there was the assistance of Allâh\nembodied in the revealed verses of the Qur’ân.\nHis stamina, endurance and forgiveness — out of a commanding position — his\npatience and standing what he detested — these were all talents, attributes and\nqualities Allâh Himself had brought him on. Even wise men have their flaws, but the\nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], unlike everybody, the more he was hurt or injured, the\nmore clement and patient he became. The more insolence an ignorant anybody\nexercised against him the more enduring he became.\n\n-- 319 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n320\n‘Aishah said:\n\"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], whenever he is given the opportunity to\nchoose between two affairs, he always chooses the easiest and the most\nconvenient. But if he is certain that it is sinful, he will be as far as he could\nfrom it. He has never avenged himself; but when the sanctity of Allâh is\nviolated he would. That would be for Allâh’s not for himself. He is the last\none to get angry and the first to be satisfied. His hospitality and generosity\nwere matchless. His gifts and endowments manifest a man who does not\nfear poverty.\" \t[Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/503]\nIbn‘Abbas said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] was the most generous. He is usually most\ngenerous of all times in Ramadan, the times at which the angel Gabriel [AWS] comes\nto see him. Gabriel used to visit him every night of Ramadan and review the Qur’ân\nwith him. Verily the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] is more generous at giving bounty or\ncharity than the blowing wind.\"\nJabir said:\n\"The Prophet [pbuh] would never deny anything he was asked for.\"[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/503]\nHis courage, his succour and his might are distinguishable. He was the most\ncourageous. He witnessed awkward and difficult times and stoodfast at them. More\nthan once brave men and daring ones fled away leaving him alone; yet he stood with\nfull composure facing the enemy without turning his back. All brave men must have\nexperienced fleeing once or have been driven off the battlefield at a round at a time\nexcept the Prophet [pbuh]. ‘Ali said: \"Whenever the fight grew fierce and the eyes of\nfighters went red, we used to resort to the Prophet [pbuh] for succour. He was\nalways the closest to the enemy.\" \t[As-Shifa 1/89]\nAnas said: \"One night the people of Madinah felt alarmed. People went out hurriedly\ntowards the source of sound, but the Prophet [pbuh] had already gone ahead of\nthem. He was on the horseback of Abu Talhah which had no saddle over it, and a\nsword was slung round his neck, and said to them: ‘There was nothing to be afraid\nfor.’\" \t[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/407; Sahih Muslim 2/252]\nHe was the most modest and the first one to cast his eyes down. Abu Sa‘îd Al- Khudri\nsaid: \"He was shier than a virgin in her boudoir. When he hates a thing we read it on\nhis face. [Sahih Al- Bukhari 1/504] He does not stare at anybody’s face. He always\ncasts his eyes down. He looks at the ground more than he looks sky- wards. His\nutmost looks at people are glances. He is willingly and modestly obeyed by\neverybody. He would never name a person whom he had heard ill- news about —\nwhich he hated. Instead he would say: ‘Why do certain people do so....’\"\nAl- Farazdaq verse of poem fits him very much and the best one to be said of:\n\"He casts his eyes modestly but the eyes of others are cast down due to his\nsolemnity, and words issue out of his mouth only while he is smiling.\"\nThe Prophet [pbuh] is the most just, the most decent, the most truthful at speech,\nand the honestest of all. Those who have exchanged speech with him, and even his\n\n-- 320 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n321\nenemies, acknowledge his noble qualities. Even before the Prophethood he was\nnicknamed \tAl- Ameen \t(i.e. the truthful, the truthworthy). Even then — in \tAl- Jahiliyah\n— they used to turn to him for judgement and consultation. In a version by At-\nTirmidhi, he says that ‘Ali had said that he had been told by Abu Jahl that he (Abu\nJahl) said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]: \"We do not call you a liar; but we do not\nhave faith in what you have brought.\" \t[Mishkat Al- Masabeeh 2/521] \tIn His Book, Allâh, the\nExalted, said about them:\n\"It is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses (the Qur’ân) of Allâh that\nthe \tZalimûn \t(polytheists and wrong- doers) deny.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 6:33]\nEven when Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan: \"Have you ever accused him of lying before\nthe ministry of Prophethood?\" Abu Sufyan said: \"No.\"\nHe was most modest and far from being arrogant or proud. He forbade people to\nstand up at his presence as other people usually do for their kings.\nVisiting the poor, the needy and entertaining them are some of his habits. If a slave\ninvited him, he would accept the invitation. He always sat among his friends as if he\nwere an ordinary person of them. ‘Aishah said that he used to repair his shoes, sew\nor mend his dress and to do what ordinary men did in their houses. After all, he was\na human being like others. He used to check his dress (lest it has some insects on).\nMilking the she- sheep and catering for himself were some of his normal jobs. [ibid\n2/520] The Prophet [pbuh] was the most truthful to his pledges, and it is one of his\nqualities to establish good and steady relationship with his relatives — ‘Silat- Ar-\nRahim’. He is the most merciful, gentle and amiable to all people. His way of living is\nthe simplest one. Ill- manners and indecency are two qualities completely alien to\nhim. He was decent, and did not call anybody names. He was not the sort of person\nwho cursed or made noise in the streets. He did not exchange offences with others.\nHe pushed back an offence or an error by forgiveness and overlooking. Nobody was\nallowed to walk behind him (i.e. as a bodyguard). He did not feel himself superior to\nothers not even to his slaves (men or women) as far as food or clothes were\nconcerned.\nWhoever served him should be served by him too. ‘Ugh’ (an utterance of complaint)\nis a word that had never been said by him to his servant; nor was his servant\nblamed for doing a thing or leaving it undone. Loving the poor and the needy and\nentertaining them or participating in their funerals were things the Prophet [pbuh]\nalways observed. He never contempted or disgraced a poor man for his poverty.\nOnce he was travelling with his Companions and when it was time to have food\nprepared, he asked them to slaughter a she- sheep. A man said: I will slaughter it,\nanother one said: I will skin it out. A third said: I will cook it. So the Messenger of\nAllâh [pbuh] said: I will collect wood for fire. They said: \"No. We will suffice you that\nwork.\" \"I know that you can do it for me, but I hate to be privileged. Allâh hates to\nsee a slave of his privileged to others.\" So he went and collected fire- wood. \t[Khulasa As-\nSiyar p.22]\nLet us have some of the description of Hind bin Abi Halah: \"The Messenger of Allâh\n[pbuh] was continually sad, thinking perpetually. He had no rest (i.e. for long). He\nonly spoke when it was necessary. He would remain silent for a long time and\nwhenever he spoke, he would end his talk with his jawbone but not out of the\ncorners of his mouth, i.e. (snobbishly). His speech was inclusive. He spoke\n\n-- 321 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n322\ninclusively and decisively. It was not excessive nor was it short of meaning. It was\namiable. It was in no way hard discoroning. He glorified the bounty of Allâh; even if\nit were little. If he had no liking for someone’s food, he would neither praise nor\ncriticize.\nHe was always in full control of his temper and he would never get seemed angry\nunless it was necessary. He never got angry for himself nor did he avenge himself. It\nwas for Allâh’s sanctity and religion that he always seemed angry.\nWhen he pointed at a thing he would do so with his full hand- palm, and he would\nturn it round to show surprise. If he were angry he would turn both his body and\nface aside. When he was pleased, he cast his eyes down. His laughter was mostly\nsmiling. It was then that his teeth which were like hail- stones were revealed.\nHe never spoke unless it was something closely relevant to him. He confirmed the\nbrotherhood relationship among his Companions; and thus he made them intimate\nand did not separate them or implant enmity among them. Those who were\nhonourable with their peoples, were honoured and respected by him and were\nassigned rulers over their own peoples. His cheerfulness was never withdrawn at\nanyone’s face; even at those whom he warned his people from or those whom he\nhimself was on the alert of. He visited friends and inquired about people’s affairs. He\nconfirmed what was right and criticized the awful and tried to undermine it. He was\nmoderate in all affairs. He was equal to others and was not privileged. He would\nnever act heedlessly, lest the others should get heedless. Each situation was dealt\nwith in its proper due.\nRighteousness was his target; so he was never short of it nor indifferent to it. People\nwho sat next to him were the best of their people and the best of them all were —\nfor him — those who provided common consultations. For him, the greatest ones and\nthe highest in ranks were the best at providing comfort and co- ordination and\nsuccour. Remembrance (of Allâh) was a thing he aimed at and established whenever\nhe sat down or stands up. No certain position was assigned for him to sit on. He sits\nat the end of the group, seated next to the last sitter in the place. He ordered people\nto do the same. He entertained his participiants in social gatherings alike so that the\none addressed would think that there was no one honoured by the Prophet [pbuh]\nbut himself. He whoever sat next to him or interrupted him in order to ask for his\nadvice about an affair of his, would be the first to start the talk and the one to end it.\nThe Prophet [pbuh] would listen to him patiently till he ended his speech. He never\ndenied a request to anyone, if unapproachable, then few gratifying words would\nwork, instead.\nHis magnanimity, broad mindedness his tolerance could embrace all people and\nentitled him to be regarded as father for them all. In justice, all of them were almost\nequal. Nobody was better than another except on the criterion of Allâh fearing. A\nfavoured one, to him, was the most Allâh fearing. His assembly was a meeting of\nclemency, timidness, patience and honesty. Voices were not raised in rows or riots.\nInviolable things were never violable. Fearing Allâh and worship were their means to\nsympathy and compassion. They used to esteem the old and have mercy on the\nyoung. They assisted the needy and entertained strangers.\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was always cheerful, easy, pleasant- tempered and\nlenient. He was never rude or rough nor clamorous or indecent. He was neither a\n\n-- 322 of 324 --\n\nMSA NIU\n323\nreproacher nor a praiser. He overlooked what he did not desire, yet you would never\ndespair of him. Three qualities he disposed of: hypocrisy, excessiveness, and what\nwas none of his concern. People did not fear him in three areas: — for they were not\nqualities or habits of his —: He never disparaged, or reproached nor did he seek the\ndefects or shortages of others. He only spoke things whose reward was Divinely\ndesirable. When he spoke, his listeners would attentively listen casting down their\nheads. They only spoke when he was silent. They did not have disputes or\narguments about who was to talk. He who talked in his presence would be listened to\nby everybody till he finished his talk. Their talk would be about the topic discussed or\ndelivered by their first speaker. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] used to laugh at what\nthey laughed at and admired what they used to admire. He would always show\npatience with a stranger’s harshness at talk. He used to say:\n\"When you see a person seeking an object earnestly, assist him to get his\nneed. And never ask for a reward except from the reward- Giver, i.e. Allâh.\"\n[Ash- Shifa 1/126]\nKharijah bin Zaid said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] was the most honoured among the\npeople with whom he sat. His limbs could hardly be seen. He was often silent and\nrarely talked when speech was not a necessity. He turned away from those whose\nspeech was rude or impolite. His laughter was no more than a smile. His speech,\nwhich was decisive, it was neither excessive nor incomplete. Out of reverence and\nesteem and following the example of their Prophet [pbuh], the Companions’ laughter\nat his presence — was smiling, as well.\" \t[As-Shifa 1/107]\nOn the whole the Prophet [pbuh] was ornamented with peerless attributes of\nperfection. No wonder to be like that for he was brought up, educated and taught\n(the Qur’ân) by Allâh. He was even praised by Allâh:\n\"And verily, you (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) are on an exalted standard of\ncharacter.\" \t[Al- Qur'an 68:4]\nThose were the attributes and qualities that the Prophet [pbuh] enjoyed which made\nthe hearts of souls of the people close to him, draw near to him and love him. Those\ntraits made him so popular that the restraint and enmity of his people grew less and\nthey started to embrace Islam in large crowds.\nThis description is in fact no more than a rapid review or rather short brief lines of\nMuhammad’s [pbuh] aspects of full perfection. Trying to encompass the whole\nperfect picture of the Prophet [pbuh]. No one can ever claim to be possessed of full\nknowledge or complete mastery of the great attributes of the greatest man in this\nuniverse. No one can ever give this man, the top of perfection, his due descrpition.\nHe was a man who always sought Allâh’s light, to such an extent that he was wholly\nimbued with the Qur’ânic approach.\nO Allâh! send your blessings (and the Holy Words of Yours) upon Muhammad and the\nfamily of Muhammad, as You have send blessings upon Ibrâhim and the family of\nIbrâhim. You are worthy of all praise, All Glorious.\nO Allâh! bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You have already blessed\nIbrâhim and the family of Ibrâhim. You are worthy of all praise, All Glorious.\n\n-- 323 of 324 --\n\nThis document was created with Win2PDF available at http://www.daneprairie.com.\nThe unregistered version of Win2PDF is for evaluation or non-commercial use only.\n\n-- 324 of 324 --\n\n"
